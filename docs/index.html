<p class="clear rubric" id="about-ardour-doc">1.1 - About Ardour’s documentation</p>
<p class="rubric" id="conventions-used-in-this-manual">Conventions Used In This Manual</p>
<p>This section covers some of the typographical and language conventions
used in this manual.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="keyboards-and-modifiers">Keyboards and Modifiers</p>
<p>Keyboard bindings are shown like this: s or x.</p>
<p>x means “press the key, keep it pressed and then also press the x key”.</p>
<p>Combinations such as e may be seen, which means “hold down the key <em>and</em>
the key, and then, while keeping them both down, press the e key”.</p>
<p>Different platforms have different conventions for which modifier key
(Control or Command) to use as the primary or most common modifier. When
viewing this manual from a machine identifying itself as running OS X,
Cmd will be seen where appropriate (for instance in the first example
above). On other machines Ctrl will be seen instead.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="mouse-buttons">Mouse Buttons</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="#mouse">Mouse buttons</a> are referred to as Left, Middle and Right.
Ardour can use additional buttons, but they have no default behaviour in
the program.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="mouse-click-modifiers">Mouse Click Modifiers</p>
<p>Many editing functions are performed by clicking the mouse while holding
a modifier key, for example Left.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="mouse-wheel">Mouse Wheel</p>
<p>Some GUI elements can optionally be controlled with the mouse wheel when
the pointer is hovering over them. The notation for mouse wheel action
is ⇑ ⇐ ⇓ ⇒.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="context-click">Context-click</p>
<p>The term context-click is used to indicate a Right-click on a particular
element of the graphical user interface. Although right-click is the
common, default way to do this, there are other ways to accomplish the
same thing—this term refers to any of them, and the result is always
that a menu specific to the item clicked on will be displayed.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="the-pointer">“The Pointer”</p>
<p>When the manual refers to the “pointer”, it means the on-screen
representation of the mouse position or the location of a touch action
if touch interface is being used.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="other-user-input">Other User Input</p>
<p>Ardour supports hardware controllers, such as banks of faders, knobs, or
buttons.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="menu-items">Menu Items</p>
<p>Menu items are indicated like this: Top &gt; Next &gt; Deeper. Each
“&gt;”-separated item indicates one level of a nested menu or sub-menu.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="osc-messages">OSC Messages</p>
<p>OSC messages, whether sent or received, are displayed like this:
/transport_stop.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="preferencedialog-options">Preference/Dialog Options</p>
<p>Choices in various dialogs, notably the Preferences and Properties
dialog, are indicated thus:</p>
<p>Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Audio &gt; Some Option.</p>
<p>Each successive item indicates either a menu, sub-menu, or a tabbed
dialog navigation. The final item is the one to choose or select.</p>
<p>If an option is deselected, it will look like this:</p>
<p>Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Audio &gt; Some other Option.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="user-input">User Input</p>
<p>Some dialogs or features may require the user to input data such as
this. In rare cases, certain operations will be required to be performed
at the command line of the operating system:</p>

<p class="clear rubric" id="ardour-overview">1.2 - Ardour Overview</p>
<p>Ardour is a professional digital workstation for working with audio and
MIDI.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="ardour-is-meant-for">Ardour is meant for…</p>
<p class="rubric" id="audio-engineers">Audio Engineers</p>
<p>Ardour’s core user group: people who want to record, edit, mix and
master audio and MIDI projects. When you need complete control over your
tools, when the limitations of other designs get in the way, when you
plan to spend hours or days working on a session, Ardour is there to
make things work the way you want them to.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="musicians">Musicians</p>
<p>Being the best tool to record talented performers on actual instruments
has always been a top priority for Ardour. Rather than being focused on
electronic and pop music idioms, Ardour steps out of the way to
encourage the creative process to remain where it always has been: a
musician playing a carefully designed and well built instrument.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="soundtrack-editors">Soundtrack Editors</p>
<p>Sample accurate sync and shared transport control with video playback
tools allows Ardour to provide a fast and natural environment for
creating and editing soundtracks for film and video projects.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="composers">Composers</p>
<p>Arrange audio and MIDI using the same tools and same workflow. Use
external hardware synthesizers or software instruments as sound sources.
From sound design to electro-acoustic composition to dense multitrack
MIDI editing, Ardour can help.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="ardour-features">Ardour features…</p>
<p class="rubric" id="audio-and-midi-multi-track-recording-and-editing">Audio and MIDI Multi-Track Recording and Editing</p>
<p>Any number of tracks and busses. Non-linear editing. Non-destructive
(and destructive!) recording. Any bit depth, any sample rate. Dozens of
file formats.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="plugins-with-full-sample-accurate-automation">Plugins with Full Sample Accurate Automation</p>
<p>AudioUnit, LV2, LinuxVST and LADSPA formats. FX plugins. Software
instruments. MIDI processors. Automate any parameters. Physically
manipulate them via control surfaces. Distribute processing across as
many (or as few) cores as you want.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="transport-sync-and-external-control-surfaces">Transport Sync and External Control Surfaces</p>
<p>Best-in-industry sync to MIDI timecode and LTC. Send and receive MIDI
Machine Control. Sync with JACK transport and MIDI clock. Dedicated
Mackie Control protocol support, pre-defined mappings for many MIDI
controllers plus dynamic MIDI learn. Use OSC to drive almost any
operation in Ardour.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="powerful-anywhere-to-anywhere-signal-routing">Powerful Anywhere-to-Anywhere Signal Routing</p>
<p>Complex signal flows are simple and elegant. Inputs and outputs connect
to your hardware and/or other applications. Use sends, inserts and
returns freely. Connections can be one-to-many, many-to-one or
many-to-many. Tap signal flows at any point. If you can’t connect in the
way you want with Ardour, it probably can’t be done.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="video-timeline">Video Timeline</p>
<p>Import a single video and optionally extract the soundtrack from it.
Display a frame-by-frame (thumbnail) timeline of the video. Use a
Video-monitor window, or full-screen display, of the imported video in
sync with any of the available ardour timecode sources. Lock
audio-regions to the video: Move audio-regions with the video at
video-frame granularity. Export the video, cut start/end, add blank
frames and/or mux it with the soundtrack of the current-session.</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="why-is-it-called-ardour">1.3 - Why is it called Ardour?</p>
<p>The name “Ardour” came from considerations of how to pronounce the
acronym HDR. The most obvious attempt sounds like a vowel-less “harder”
and it then was then a short step to an unrelated but slightly
homophonic word:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="line-block">
<div class="line">ardour <em>n</em> 1: a feeling of strong eagerness (usually in favor of a
person or cause); “they were imbued with a revolutionary ardor”;
“he felt a kind of religious zeal” [syn: ardor, elan, zeal]</div>
<div class="line">2: intense feeling of love [syn: ardor]</div>
<div class="line">3: feelings of great warmth and intensity; “he spoke with great
ardor” [syn: ardor, fervor, fervour, fervency, fire, fervidness]</div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Given the work required to develop Ardour, and the personality of its
primary author, the name seemed appropriate even without the vague
relationship to HDR.</p>
<p>Years later, another interpretation of “Ardour” appeared, this time
based on listening to non-native English speakers attempt to pronounce
the word. Rather than “Ardour”, it became “Our DAW”, which seemed
poetically fitting for a Digital Audio Workstation whose source code and
design belongs to a group of collaborators.</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="why-write-a-daw-for-linux">1.4 - Why Write a DAW for Linux?</p>
<p>There are already a number of excellent digital audio workstations. To
mention just a few: ProTools, Nuendo, Samplitude, Digital Performer,
Logic, Cubase (SX), Sonar, along with several less well known systems
such as SADIE, SAWStudio and others. Each of these programs has its
strengths and weaknesses, although over the last few years most of them
have converged on a very similar set of core features. However, each of
them suffers from two problems when seen from the perspective of
Ardour’s development group:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>they do not run natively on Linux</li>
<li>they are not available in source code form, making modifications,
improvements, bugfixes by technically inclined users or their friends
or consultants impossible.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is fairly understandable that most existing proprietary DAWs do not
run on Linux, given the rather small (but growing) share of the desktop
market that Linux has. However, when surveying the landscape of “popular
operating systems”, we find:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>older versions of Windows: plagued by abysmal stability and appalling
security</li>
<li>newer versions of Windows seem stable but still suffer from security
problems</li>
<li>OS X: a nice piece of engineering that is excellent for audio work
but only runs on proprietary hardware and still lacks the flexibility
and adaptability of Linux.</li>
</ul>
<p>Security matters today, and will matter more in the future as more and
more live or semi-live network based collaborations take place.</p>
<p>Let’s contrast this with Linux, an operating system which:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>can stay up for months (or even years) without issues</li>
<li>is endlessly configurable down to the tiniest detail</li>
<li>is not owned by any single corporate entity, ensuring its life and
direction are not intertwined with that of a company (for a contrary
example, consider BeOS)</li>
<li>is fast and efficient</li>
<li>runs on almost any computing platform ever created, including old
“slow” systems and new “tiny” systems (e.g. Raspberry Pi)</li>
<li>is one of the most secure operating systems “out of the box”</li>
</ul>
<p>More than anything, however, Ardour’s primary author uses Linux and
wanted a DAW that ran there.</p>
<p>Having written a DAW for Linux, it turned out to be relatively easy to
port Ardour to OS X, mostly because of the excellent work done by the
JACK OS X group that ported JACK to OS X.</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="isnt-this-a-really-complicated-program">1.5 - Isn’t This a Really Complicated Program?</p>
<p>There is no point in pretending that Ardour is a simple, easy to use
program. The development group has worked hard to try to make simple
things reasonably easy, common tasks quick, and hard and/or uncommon
things possible. There is no doubt that there is more to do in this
area, as well as polishing the user interface to improve its
intuitiveness and work flow characteristics.</p>
<p>At the same time, multi-track, multi-channel, non-linear,
non-destructive audio editing is a far from simple process. Doing it
right requires not only a good ear, but a solid appreciation of basic
audio concepts and a robust mental model/metaphor of what one is doing.
Ardour is not a simple “audio recorder”—it can certainly be used to
record stereo (or even mono) material in a single track, but the program
has been designed around much richer capabilities than this.</p>
<p>Some people complain that Ardour is not “intuitive” to use—its lead
developer has <a class="reference external" href="https://community.ardour.org/node/3322">some thoughts on
that</a>.</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="creating-music-with-ardour">1.6 - Creating Music with Ardour</p>
<p>Ardour can be used in many different ways, from extremely simple to
extremely complex. Many projects can be handled using the following kind
of workflow:</p>
<p class="rubric" id="stage-1-creating-the-project">Stage 1: Creating The Project</p>
<p>The first step is to create a new session, or open an existing one. A
session consists of a folder containing a session file that defines all
the information about the session. All media files used by the session
are usually stored within the session folder.</p>
<p>More details on sessions can be found in <a class="reference external" href="#sessions">Sessions</a>
chapter.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="stage-2-creating-and-importing-audio-and-midi-data">Stage 2: Creating and Importing Audio and MIDI Data</p>
<p>Once a session has been created, it will be necessary to add some audio
and/or MIDI material to it—which can be done in one of 3 ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Record incoming audio or MIDI data, either via audio or MIDI hardware
connected to the computer, or from other applications</li>
<li>Create new MIDI data using the mouse and/or various dialogs</li>
<li>Import existing media files into the session</li>
</ul>
<p>MIDI recordings consist of performance data (“play note X at time T”)
rather than actual sound. As a result, they are more flexible than
actual audio, since the precise sound that they will generate when
played depends on where the MIDI data is sent to. Two different
synthesizers may produce very different sounds in response to the same
incoming MIDI data.</p>
<p>Audio recordings can be made from external instruments with electrical
outputs (keyboards, guitars, etc.), or via microphones or other sound
capturing equipment.</p>
<p>Ardour can use the JACK Audio Connection Kit for all audio and MIDI I/O,
making recording audio/MIDI from other applications fundamentally
identical to recording audio/MIDI from audio/MIDI hardware.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="stage-3-editing-and-arranging">Stage 3: Editing and Arranging</p>
<p>Once there is material within the session, it can be arranged in time.
This is done in one of the two main windows of Ardour: the Editor
window.</p>
<p>Audio/MIDI data appears in chunks called regions, which are arranged
into horizontal lanes called tracks. Tracks are stacked vertically in
the Editor window. Regions can be copied, shortened, moved, and deleted
without changing the actual data stored in the session at all—Ardour is
a non-destructive editor. (Almost) nothing done while editing will ever
modify the files stored on disk (with the exception of the session file
itself).</p>
<p>Many transformations can be done to the contents of regions, again
without altering anything on disk. It is possible to alter, move, delete
and remove silence from audio regions, for example.</p>
<p>MIDI regions can also be copied, moved, shortened, or deleted without
altering the MIDI files, though any edit like adding, suppressing or
moving <em>notes</em> inside a region results in a modification of the
underlying MIDI file.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="stage-4-mixing-and-adding-effects">Stage 4: Mixing and Adding Effects</p>
<p>Once the arrangement of the session mostly complete, the next step is
the mixing phase. Mixing is a broad term to cover the way the audio
signals that the session generates during playback are processed and
added together into a final result that is actually heard. It can
involve altering the relative levels of various parts of the session,
adding effects that improve or transform certain elements, and others
that bring the sound of the whole session to a new level.</p>
<p>Ardour allows automation of changes to any mixing parameters (such as
volume, panning, and effects controls)—it will record the changes made
over time, using a mouse or keyboard or some external control device,
and can play back those changes later. This is very useful because often
the settings needed will vary in one part of a session compared to
another—rather than using a single setting for the volume of a track, it
may need increases followed by decreases (for example, to track the
changing volume of a singer). Using automation can make all of this
relatively easy.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="stage-5-export">Stage 5: Export</p>
<p>Once the arrangement and mix of the session is finalized, a single audio
file that contains a ready-to-listen to version of the work is usually
desired. Ardour allows the exporting of audio files in a variety of
formats (simultaneously in some cases). This exported file would
typically be used in creating a CD, or be the basis for digital
distribution of the work.</p>
<p>Of course it is sometimes desirable to export material that isn’t
finished yet—for example, to give a copy to another party to mix on
their own system. Ardour allows exporting as much of a session as
desired, at any time, in any supported format.</p>

<p class="clear rubric" id="ardour-basics">2 - Ardour Basics</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="starting-ardour">2.1 - Starting Ardour</p>
<p>There are several ways of starting Ardour, which may vary depending on
which platform it is being used on:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>by double-clicking the Ardour icon in the platform’s file manager
(e.g. Nautilus on Linux, Finder on OS X)</li>
<li>by double-clicking on an Ardour session file in the platform’s file
manager</li>
<li>on Linux, Ardour can also be started via the command line (see below)</li>
</ul>
<p>When Ardour is run for the very first time, a special dialog is
displayed that will ask several questions about the system’s setup. The
questions will not be asked again, but the choices thus made can always
be modified via the Edit &gt; Preferences dialog.</p>
<p>If JACK is needed, in general, it is sensible to start it <em>before</em>
Ardour is run. Though this is not strictly necessary, it will provide
more control and options over JACK’s operation. JACK can be started
through the CLI of a terminal, or by using a GUI program, like
<a class="reference external" href="https://qjackctl.sourceforge.io/">QjackCtl</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="http://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/Applications:Cadence">Cadence</a>.</p>
<p>If Ardour is opened without specifying an existing session, it will
display the Session &gt; New… dialog and the Audio/MIDI Setup dialog. See
<a class="reference external" href="#newopen-session-dialog">New/Open Session Dialog</a> for a description
of those dialogs.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="starting-ardour-from-the-command-line-linux">Starting Ardour From the Command Line (Linux)</p>
<p>Like (almost) any other program on Linux, Ardour can be started on the
command line. Type the following command in a terminal window:</p>
<p>Ardour5
To start Ardour with an existing session, use:</p>
<p>Ardour5 <em>/path/to/session</em>
Replace /path/to/session with the actual path of the session. Either the
session folder or any session file inside the folder can be specified,
including snapshots.</p>
<p>To start Ardour with a new, named session, use:</p>
<p>Ardour5 -N <em>/path/to/session</em>

</div></blockquote>
<p>In order to fully grasp the terms used in Ardour (and this manual), it
is necessary to understand what things like sessions, tracks, busses,
regions and so on—as used in Ardour—are.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="sessions">Sessions</p>
<p>An Ardour session is a container for an entire project. A session may
contain an arbitrary number of tracks and busses consisting of audio and
MIDI data, along with information on processing those tracks, a mix of
levels, and everything else related to the project. A session might
typically contain a song, an entire album, or a complete live recording.</p>
<p>Ardour sessions are kept in directories; these directories contain one
or more session files, some or all of the audio and MIDI data, and a
number of other state files that Ardour requires. The session file
describes the structure of the session, and holds automation data and
other details.</p>
<p>Ardour’s session file is written in XML format, which is advantageous as
it is <em>somewhat</em> human-readable and human-editable in a crisis. Sound
files are stored in one of a number of optional formats, and MIDI files
as SMF.</p>
<p>It is also possible for Ardour sessions to reference sound and MIDI
files outside the session directory, to conserve disk space and avoid
unnecessary copying if the data is available elsewhere on the disk.</p>
<p>Ardour has a single current session at all times; if Ardour is started
without specifying one, it will offer to load or create one.</p>
<p>More details can be found in the <a class="reference external" href="#sessions">Sessions</a> chapter.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="tracks">Tracks</p>
<p>A track is a concept common to most DAWs, and also used in Ardour.
Tracks can record audio or MIDI data to disk, and then replay it with
processing. They also allow the audio or MIDI data to be edited in a
variety of different ways.</p>
<p>In a typical pop production, one track might be used for the kick drum,
another for the snare, more perhaps for the drum overheads and others
for bass, guitars and vocals.</p>
<p>Ardour can record to any number of tracks at one time, and then play
those tracks back. On playback, a track’s recordings may be processed by
any number of plugins, panned, and/or its level altered to achieve a
suitable mix.</p>
<p>A track’s type is really only related to the type of data that it stores
on disk. It is possible, for example, to have a MIDI track with a
synthesizer plugin which converts MIDI to audio. Even though the track
remains MIDI (in the sense that its on-disk recordings are MIDI), its
output may be audio-only.</p>
<p>More details can be found in the <a class="reference external" href="#tracks">Tracks</a> chapter.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="busses">Busses</p>
<p>Busses are another common concept in both DAWs and hardware mixers. They
are similar in many ways to tracks; they process audio or MIDI, and can
run processing plugins. The only difference is that their input is
obtained from other tracks or busses, rather than from disk.</p>
<p>A bus might typically be used to collect together the outputs of related
tracks. Consider, for example, a three track recording of a drum kit;
given kick, snare and overhead tracks, it may be helpful to connect the
output of each to a bus called “drums”, so that the drum kit’s level can
be set as a unit, and processing (such as equalization or compression)
can be applied to the mix of all the tracks. Such busses are also called
groups.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="regions">Regions</p>
<p>A track may contain many segments of audio or MIDI. Ardour contains
these segments in things called regions, which are self-contained
snippets of audio or MIDI data. Any recording pass, for example,
generates a region on each track that is enabled for recording. Regions
can be subjected to many editing operations; they may be moved around,
split, trimmed, copied, and so on.</p>
<p>More details can be found at <a class="reference external" href="#working-with-regions">Working With
Regions</a>.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="playlists">Playlists</p>
<p>The details of what exactly each track should play back is described by
a playlist. A playlist is simply a list of regions; each track always
has an active playlist, and can have other playlists which can be
switched in and out as required.</p>
<p>More details can be found in the <a class="reference external" href="#playlists">Playlists</a> chapter.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="plugins">Plugins</p>
<p>Ardour allows processing audio and MIDI using any number of plugins.
These are external pieces of code, commonly seen as VST plugins on
Windows or AU plugins on Mac OS X. Ardour supports the following plugin
standards:</p>

</table>
<p>Ardour has some support for running Windows VST plugins on Linux, but
this is rather complicated, extremely difficult for the Ardour
developers to debug, and generally unreliable, as it requires running a
large amount of Windows code in an emulated environment. If it is at all
possible, it is strongly advisable to use native LADSPA, LV2 or Linux
VST plugins on Linux, or AU on Mac OS X.</p>

<p class="clear rubric" id="using-the-mouse">2.3 - Using the Mouse</p>
<p class="rubric" id="clicking">Clicking</p>
<p>Throughout this manual, the term click refers to the act of pressing and
releasing the Left mouse button. This action is used to select objects,
activate buttons, turn choices on and off, pop up menus and so forth. On
touch surfaces, it also corresponds to a single, one-finger tap on the
GUI.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="right-clicking">Right Clicking</p>
<p>The term right-click refers to the act of pressing and releasing the
Right mouse button. This action is used to pop up context menus (hence
the term “context click”, which will also be seen). It is also used by
default in combination with the shift key to delete objects within the
editor window.</p>
<p>Some mice designed for use with Mac OS X may have only one button. By
convention, pressing and holding the Control key while clicking is
interpreted as a right-click by many applications.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="middle-clicking">Middle Clicking</p>
<p>A middle-click refers to the act of pressing and releasing the Middle
mouse button. Not all mice have a middle click button (see the
<a class="reference external" href="#mouse">Mouse</a> chapter for details). Sometimes the scroll wheel acts
as a clickable middle button. This action is used for time-constrained
region copying and mapping MIDI bindings.</p>
<p>Internally, your operating system may identify the mouse buttons as
Button1, Button2, and Button3, respectively. It may be possible to
invert the order of buttons to accommodate left-handed users, or to
re-assign them arbitrarily. This manual assumes the canonical order.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="double-clicking">Double Clicking</p>
<p>A double click refers to two rapid press/release cycles on the leftmost
mouse button. The time interval between the two actions that determines
whether this is seen as two clicks or one double click is controlled by
your system preferences, not by Ardour.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="dragging">Dragging</p>
<p>A drag primarily refers to the act of pressing the leftmost mouse
button, moving the mouse with the button held down, and then releasing
the button. On touch surfaces, this term also corresponds to a single
one-finger touch-move-release action.</p>
<p>Ardour also uses the middle mouse button for certain kinds of drags,
which will be referred to as a middle-drag.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="modifiers">Modifiers</p>
<p>There are many actions in Ardour that can be carried out using a mouse
button in combination with a modifier key. When the manual refers to
Left, it means that you should first press the key, carry out a left
click while is held down, and then finally release the key.</p>
<p>Available modifiers depend on your platform:</p>
<p class="rubric" id="linux-modifiers">Linux Modifiers</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ctrl (Control)</li>
<li>Shift</li>
<li>Alt</li>
<li>Win (Super/Windows)</li>
</ul>
<p class="rubric" id="os-x-modifiers">OS X Modifiers</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Cmd (Command, “windmill”)</li>
<li>Ctrl (Control)</li>
<li>Alt (Option)</li>
<li>Shift</li>
</ul>
<p class="rubric" id="scroll-wheel">Scroll Wheel</p>
<p>Ardour can make good use of a scroll wheel on the mouse (assuming it has
one), which can be utilized for a variety of purposes. Scroll wheels
generate vertical scroll events, ⇑ (ScrollUp) and ⇓ (ScrollDown). Some
also emit horizontal events, ⇐ (ScrollLeft) and ⇒ (ScrollRight).</p>
<p>When appropriate, Ardour will differentiate between these two different
scroll axes. Otherwise it will interpret ScrollDown and ScrollLeft as
equivalent and similarly interpret ScrollUp and ScrollRight as
equivalent.</p>
<p>Typically, scroll wheel input is used to adjust continuous controls such
as faders and knobs, or to scroll vertically or horizontally inside a
window.</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="basic-gui-operations">2.4 - Basic GUI Operations</p>
<p>By default, Ardour will show helpful tooltips about the purpose and use
of each GUI element if the pointer is positioned over it and hovered
there for a short while. These little pop-up messages can be a good way
to discover the purpose of many aspects of the GUI.</p>
<p>Pop-ups can also be distracting for experienced users, who may wish to
disable them via Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; GUI &gt; Show tooltip if mouse hovers
over a control.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="selection-techniques">Selection Techniques</p>
<p>Ardour follows the conventions used by most other computer software
(including other DAWs) for selecting objects in the GUI.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="selecting-individual-objects">Selecting individual objects</p>
<p>Clicking on an object (sometimes on a particular part of its on-screen
representation) will select the object, and deselect other similar
objects.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="selecting-multiple-similar-objects">Selecting multiple (similar) objects</p>
<p>A left-click on an object toggles its selected status, so using left on
a series of objects will select (or deselect) each one of them. A
completely arbitrary set of selections can be constructed with this
technique.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="selecting-a-range-of-objects">Selecting a range of objects</p>
<p>In cases where the idea of “select all objects between this one and that
one” makes sense, select one object and then left-click on another to
select both of them as well as all objects in between.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="time-range-selection">Time range selection</p>
<p>To select a time range in the Editor, Left-click and drag the mouse. A
Left drag then lets you create other ranges and a left-click extends a
range to cover a wider area.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="selection-undo">Selection Undo</p>
<p>The set of objects (including time range) that are selected at any one
time is known as the selection. Each time an object is selected or
deselected, the new selection is stored in an undo/redo stack. This
stack is cleared each time the content of the timeline changes.</p>
<p>If a complex selection has been built up and then accidentally cleared
it, choosing Edit &gt; Undo Selection Change will restore the previous
selection. If a selection is undone and a return to the state before the
undo is desired, choosing Edit &gt; Redo Selection Change will take the
selection back to where it was before Edit &gt; Undo Selection Change was
chosen.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="cut-and-paste-operations">Cut and Paste Operations</p>
<p>The clipboard is a holder for various kinds of objects (regions, control
events, plugins) that is used during cut-and-paste operations.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="cut">Cut</p>
<p>A cut operation removes selected objects and places them in the
clipboard. The existing contents of the clipboard are overwritten. The
default key binding is x.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="copy">Copy</p>
<p>A copy of the selected objects are placed in clipboard. There is no
effect on the selected objects themselves. The existing contents of the
clipboard are overwritten. The default key binding is c.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="paste">Paste</p>
<p>The current contents of the clipboard are pasted (inserted) into the
session, using the current edit point as the destination. The contents
of the clipboard remain unchanged—the same item can be pasted multiple
times. The default key binding is v.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="deleting-objects">Deleting Objects</p>
<p>Within the Editor window (and to some extent within the Mixer window
too), there are several techniques for deleting objects (regions,
control points, and more).</p>
<p class="rubric" id="using-the-mouse-and-keyboard">Using the mouse and keyboard</p>
<p>Select the object(s) to be deleted and then press the Del key. This does
<strong>not</strong> put the deleted object(s) in the clipboard, so they cannot be
pasted elsewhere.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="using-normal-cut-and-paste-shortcuts">Using normal cut and paste shortcuts</p>
<p>Select the object(s) and then press x. This puts the deleted object(s)
in the clipboard so that they can be pasted elsewhere.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="using-just-the-mouse">Using just the mouse</p>
<p>By default, Shift Right will delete the clicked-upon object. Like the
Del key, this does <strong>not</strong> put the deleted object(s) in the clipboard.</p>
<p>The modifier and mouse button used for this can be controlled via Edit &gt;
Preferences &gt; User Interaction &gt; Delete using …. Any modifier and mouse
button combination can be used.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="undoredo-for-editing">Undo/Redo for Editing</p>
<p>While editing, it sometimes happens that an unintended change is made,
or a choice is made that is later decided to be wrong. All changes to
the arrangement of session components (regions, control points) along
the timeline can be undone (and redone if necessary).</p>
<p>The default keybindings are Z for Undo and R for Redo. These match the
conventions of most other applications that provide undo/redo.</p>
<p>Changes are also saved to the session history file, so that undo/redo is
possible even if the session is closed and reopened later, even if
Ardour is exited in between.</p>
<p>The maximum number of changes that can be undone can be configured under
Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Misc &gt; Undo. The maximum number of changes stored
in the history file is a separate parameter, and can also be set in the
same place.</p>
<p>In addition to the normal undo (which works only on actions that change
the timeline), there is a visual undo which will revert any command that
affects the display of the editor window. Its shortcut is Z. There is
also an undo for selection; see “Selection Techniques” above.</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="keyboard-and-mouse-shortcuts">3 - Keyboard and Mouse Shortcuts</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="default-keyboard-bindings">3.1 - Default Keyboard Bindings</p>
<p>Almost every available function in Ardour can be bound to a keyboard
shortcut (and those few that cannot will usually respond to an <a class="reference external" href="#controlling-ardour-with-osc">OSC
command</a>). Ardour comes with a rich set
of default key bindings for the most commonly used functions.</p>
<p>These bindings strive to be mnemonic, that is, easy and intuitive to
remember, and follow widely accepted conventions. As a general rule, the
first letter of an operation will be used for as a shortcut, if
available. This does not necessarily lead to the best ergonomics for
rapid editing—there are alternative binding sets for that—but it does
make it simpler for newcomers to remember some of the most useful ones,
for example:</p>
<p>S for Region &gt; Edit &gt; Split or P for Transport &gt; Playhead &gt; Playhead to
Mouse.</p>
<p>Existing key bindings in menus are listed on the right side of the menu
items.</p>
<p>Almost every key binding in Ardour can be looked for and/or changed in
Window &gt; Key Bindings (which is bound to K).</p>
<p>Ardour will silently reassign the binding of a key combination that is
already in use, possibly removing a standard keyboard shortcut without
any warning. This might lead to confusion when asking for help—when the
explanation is given in terms of a standard key binding—which will have
a completely different effect on the system with the modified key
bindings.</p>
<p>The conventions for using modifier keys (, , , etc.) differ among
platforms, so different default bindings for each are provided.</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="mnemonic-bindings-for-linux">3.2 - Mnemonic Bindings for Linux</p>
<p>A printable cheat-sheet with the mnemonic bindings for Linux is
available for download in <a class="reference external" href="/files/a3_mnemonic_cheatsheet.pdf">US
Letter</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="/files/a3_mnemonic_cheatsheet-a4.pdf">A4</a> paper format.</p>
<p>This set of bindings assumes an en_US keyboard. However, most if not all
bindings will also work on other keyboards when the AltGr key is used to
compose those glyphs that are not directly accessible.</p>

<p class="clear rubric" id="ardour-configuration">Part II - Ardour Configuration</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="ardour-systems">4 - Ardour Systems</p>
<p>Using a general purpose computer for the recording and playback of
digital audio is not trivial. This chapter covers some of the most
common pitfalls encountered on the way to creating a reliable and
powerful audio workstation.</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="the-right-computer-system-for-digital-audio">4.1 - The Right Computer System for Digital Audio</p>
<p>It is nice to think that one could just go and buy any computer, install
a bit of software on it and start using it to record and create music.
This idea isn’t necessarily wrong, but there are some important details
that it misses. Any computer that that can be bought today (since
somewhere around the end of 2012) is capable of recording and processing
a lot of audio data. It will come with a builtin audio interface that
can accept inputs from microphones and/or electrical instruments; it
will have a disk with a huge amount of space for storing audio files.</p>
<p>However, when recording, editing and mixing music, it is generally
desirable to have very little latency between the time a sound is
generated and when it can be heard. When the audio signal flows through
a computer, that means that the computer has to be able to receive the
signal, process it and send it back out again as quickly as possible.
And this is where it becomes very important <em>what</em> computer system is
being used for this task, because it is <strong>absolutely not</strong> the case that
<em>any</em> computer can do it well.</p>
<p>Routing audio through a computer will always cause some delay, but if it
is small, it will generally never be noticed. There are also ways to
work in which the delay does not matter at all (for example, not sending
the output from the computer to speakers).</p>
<p>The latency that is typically needed for working with digital audio is
in the 1–5&nbsp;ms range. For comparison, if one is sitting 1&nbsp;m (3&nbsp;ft) from a
set of speakers, the time the sound takes to reach the ears is about
3&nbsp;ms. Any modern computer can limit the delay to 100&nbsp;ms; most can keep
it under 50&nbsp;ms. Many will be able to get down to 10&nbsp;ms without too much
effort. Attempting to reduce the latency on a computer that cannot
physically do it will cause clicks and glitches in the audio, which is
clearly undesirable.</p>

various kinds of external USB

audio interfaces. It is very

BIOS or at the OS level.</td>

<td>If the audio interface is forced
by the computer to share an
interrupt line (basically a way
to tell the CPU that something
needs its attention) with too
many other (or wrong) devices,
this can also prevent the audio
interface from keeping up with
the flow of data. In laptops it
is generally impossible to do
anything about this. In many
desktop systems, it is possible
at the BIOS level to reassign
interrupts to work around the
problem.</td>

<tr class="row-odd"><td>SMIs</td>
<td>SMIs are interrupts sent by the
motherboard to tell the computer
about the state of various
hardware. They cannot safely be
disabled, and they can take a
relatively long time to process.
It is better to have a
motherboard which never sends
SMIs at all—this is also a
requirement for realtime stock
trading systems, which have
similar issues with latency.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Hyperthreading</td>
<td>This technology is becoming less
common as actual multi-core CPUs
become the norm, but it still
exists and is generally not good
for realtime performance.
Sometimes this can be disabled in
the BIOS, sometimes it cannot. A
processor that uses
hyperthreading will be less
stable in very low latency
situations than one without.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Excessive vibration</td>
<td>This doesn’t affect the flow of
data to or from the audio
interface, but it can cause the
flow of data to and from disk
storage to become <em>much</em> slower.
If a computer going to be used in
an environment with loud live
sound (specifically, high bass
volume), make sure it is placed
so that the disk is not subjected
to noticeable vibration. The
vibrations will physically
displace the read-write heads of
disk, and the resulting errors
will force a retry of the reading
from the disk. Retrying over and
over massively reduces the rate
at which data can be read from
the disk. Avoid this.</td>

<p class="clear rubric" id="mouse">4.2 - The Right Mouse</p>
<p>Ardour is designed to work best with a three button mouse equipped with
a scroll wheel. While it can be used with a two button mouse or
touchpad, at least two key operations will not be (easily) available:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>time-constrained region copying</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="#generic-midi-learn">MIDI bindings</a> created by “learning” them
from incoming MIDI data</li>
</ul>
<p>It is strongly encouraged to invest in a three-button mouse. A good
quality mouse (especially one with a weighted, latchable scroll wheel)
will make the use of Ardour vastly more efficient. They are cheap, and
time is not.</p>
<p>For information on how to use the mouse in Ardour, see <a class="reference external" href="#using-the-mouse">Using the
mouse</a>.</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="setting-up-your-system">5 - System Specific Setup</p>
<p>It is unfortunate, but some OSes and/or Desktop Environments will cause
problems that are beyond the capability of Ardour to address. The
following covers some of the known problems and how to work around them.</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="ubuntu-linux">5.1 - Ubuntu Linux</p>
<p>Ubuntu Linux is the most popular variety of Linux in use on desktop and
laptop systems. It has the backing of a for-profit corporation
(Canonical Inc.), a defined philosophy and a huge and worldwide user
base. As a result, it is a common platform for people who want to use
Ardour and other tools for music creation and pro-audio work.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="high-level-recommendations-for-ubuntu-users">High Level Recommendations for Ubuntu Users</p>
<p>Currently, installing pro audio applications on vanilla Ubuntu requires
some configuration, in order for the user to gain realtime privilege
(read below). Ubuntu Studio, which is an official flavor of Ubuntu, and
thus shares the repositories with Ubuntu, has this already configured.
Other distributions, such as KXStudio, and Dreamstudio are largely based
on Ubuntu, and like Ubuntu Studio, has these settings pre-configured,
while also containing customized versions of Ubuntu packages, which
often are more up to date.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="installing-ardour">Installing Ardour</p>
<p>There may be unintended differences, and even bugs in Ubuntu native
packages, as a result of a different building method. For this reason,
Ardour developers highly recommend installing the official ready-to-run
version of the program that can be downloaded from
<a class="reference external" href="https://community.ardour.org/download">ardour.org</a>, as Ubuntu native
packages are not supported in the official Ardour forums or other
support channels.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to install the latest version of Ardour:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Download the latest release from
<a class="reference external" href="https://community.ardour.org/download">ardour.org</a>.</li>
<li>Right-click the downloaded file and choose properties.</li>

<p class="rubric" id="problems-with-the-interaction-between-pulseaudio-and-jack">Problems with the interaction between PulseAudio and JACK</p>
<p class="rubric" id="background-info">Background Info</p>
<p>Like many distributions, Ubuntu has decided to use PulseAudio as the
default audio system. PulseAudio is a rich and capable system that
provides excellent services for typical users of Linux on the desktop.
However, it is not capable of the type of performance that tools like
Ardour require and in particular does not offer the possibility of
sending audio between applications that can make the Linux audio
environment a very interesting one.</p>
<p>This would not be a problem if it were not for the fact that JACK will
not run correctly (if at all) if it needs to use the same
soundcard/audio interface that PulseAudio is using. And since,
PulseAudio on Ubuntu is configured by default to always use the
(typically single) audio interface on the computer, this is a bit of a
problem.</p>
<p>The developers of JACK and PulseAudio got together in 2009 and agreed
upon a mechanism by which PulseAudio and JACK could cooperate in their
use of a single soundcard. Whether or not PulseAudio is running by
default, when JACK starts up it sends out a request to use the
soundcard. If PulseAudio is running, it will give up its use of the
soundcard to allow JACK to take over (and can optionally be told to
route its own audio through JACK). When JACK finishes, it sends out
another message, and PulseAudio can once again use the soundcard
directly.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="what-is-the-problem">What is the problem?</p>
<p>The specific issues known at this time for all flavors of Ubuntu 12.04
and 12.10 are:</p>
<ul class="simple">

<p>To function as intended, JACK needs to run with access to two operating
system facilities called realtime scheduling and memory locking. This
means that the user who starts JACK <em>must</em> be allowed access to these
facilities. By default, Ubuntu does create a user group that has this
permission but—it does not put new users into this group by default.

<p class="clear rubric" id="io-setup">6 - I/O Setup</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="connecting-audio-and-midi-devices">6.1 - Connecting Audio and MIDI Devices</p>
<p>Normally Ardour does not care about how audio and MIDI gets into the
computer—it pretty much deals only with its own inputs and outputs; it
is up to the user to ensure that all external routing is sound. After
all, Ardour has no way to know how signals from the outside world get to
it. However, there are some things that Ardour can do to help
troubleshoot problems with audio and MIDI connections—at least on the
computer side.</p>
<p>For example, a typical setup might include a microphone that feeds a
mixer that then feeds the computer. A failure can occur anywhere in that
signal chain, including the cables that connect everything together. As
far as Ardour is concerned, the most important connection is the one
coming from the sound source to the physical audio input of the
computer—in this example, the cable connecting between the mixer and the
computer.</p>
<p>Common sense and basic troubleshooting skills are needed when problems
arise, and in the above example, one would have to go through the entire
signal chain to ensure that each component was working as it should.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="common-problems">Common Problems</p>
<p>Ardour tries to set things up in a sane manner by automatically
connecting the hardware inputs of the computer to its master input and
the hardware outputs to the master output. If the signal coming into the
hardware inputs is active, the meters on Ardour’s master channel should
move. If they don’t, some things to check include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Making sure there is actually an input signal</li>
<li>Making sure the input signal is getting into the computer</li>
<li>Making sure that Ardour is talking to the correct sound card</li>
<li>Making sure that the sound card in use by Ardour is working properly</li>
</ul>
<p class="clear rubric" id="using-more-than-one-audio-device">6.2 - Using More Than One Audio Device</p>
<p>Ardour will only ever deal with a single audio device. When it is
desired to use more than one audio device at the same time, there are
two choices:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Use Ardour to start JACK (which handles all audio I/O), and create a
“fake” audio device which represents all the multiple devices to be
used. How to do this is platform dependent and described below.</li>
<li>Use a different tool to start JACK and manage all the devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ardour is fundamentally designed to be a component in a pro-audio/music
creation environment. Standard operating practice for such setups
involves using only a single digital sample clock (something counting
off the time between audio samples). This means that trying to use
multiple independent soundcards is problematic, because each soundcard
has its own sample clock, running independently from the others. Over
time, these different clocks drift out of sync with each other, which
causes glitches in the audio. This drift cannot be stopped, although in
some cases the effects may be insignificant enough that they might not
be noticeable.</p>
<p>Thus, in an ideal world, a single device with a single clock and all the
inputs, outputs and other features needed should be used. Of course,
there are those who like to point out that this is not an ideal world,
and believe that software should make up for this.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="os-x">OS X</p>
<p>In CoreAudio, aggregate devices provide a method to use multiple
soundcards as a single device. For example, two eight-channel devices
can be aggregated so that 16 channels can be recorded in Ardour.</p>
<div class="note"><p>When using a <em>single</em> typical 3rd party audio interface (such as those
from Apogee, RME, Presonus, and many others), <em>or</em> using JackPilot or a
similar application to start JACK, there is no need to worry about any
of this. An aggregate device only needs to be set up if any of the
following conditions are true:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Two entirely separate devices are used <em>and</em> JACK is started using
Ardour</li>
<li>A builtin audio device is used <em>and</em> JACK is started using Ardour</li>
<li>More than two entirely separate devices are used</li>
</ul>
</div><p>In the case of a builtin audio device, an aggregate device that combines

<p class="clear rubric" id="monitor-setup-in-ardour">6.3 - Monitor Setup in Ardour</p>
<p>Ardour has three main settings which affect how monitoring is performed.
The first is Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Signal Flow &gt; Record monitoring
handled by. There are two or three options here, depending on the
capabilities of the hardware.</p>
<p>The other two settings are more complex. One is Tape machine mode, found
in the same dialog, and the other is the Session &gt; Properties &gt;
Monitoring automatically follows transport state setting.</p>
<p>Monitoring also depends on the state of the track’s record-enable
button, the session record-enable button, and on whether or not the
transport is rolling.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="software-or-hardware-monitoring-modes">Software or Hardware Monitoring Modes</p>

<p class="rubric" id="monitoring-in-non-tape-machine-mode">Monitoring in Non-Tape-Machine Mode</p>
<p>When Tape-Machine mode is off, and a track is armed, Ardour <em>always</em>
monitors the live input, except in one case: if the transport is

<p>Unarmed tracks will play back their contents from disc, unless the

track monitors its live input.</p>

<p class="clear rubric" id="working-with-synchronization">7 - Synchronization</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="on-clock-and-time">7.1 - On Clock and Time</p>
<p>Synchronization in multimedia involves two concepts which are often
confused: clock (or speed) and time (location in time).</p>
<p>A clock determines the speed at which one or more systems operate. In
the audio world this is generally referred to as <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_clock">Word
Clock</a>. It does not carry
any absolute reference to a point in time: A clock is used to keep a
system’s sample rate regular and accurate. Word clock is usually at the
frequency of the sample rate—at 48&nbsp;kHz, its period is about 20&nbsp;μs. Word
Clock is the most common sample rate based clock but other clocks do
exist such as Black and Burst, Tri-Level and DARS. Sample rates can be
derived from these clocks as well.</p>
<p>Time or timecode specifies an absolute position on a timeline, such as
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">01:02:03:04</span></code> (expressed as Hours:Mins:Secs:Frames). It is actual
<em>data</em> and not a clock <em>signal</em> per se. The granularity of timecode is
Video Frames and is an order of magnitude lower than, say, Word Clock
which is counted in samples. A typical frame rate is 25&nbsp;fps with a
period of 40&nbsp;ms. In the case of 48&nbsp;kHz and 25&nbsp;fps, there are 1920 audio
samples per video frame.</p>
<p>The concepts of clock and timecode are reflected in JACK and Ardour:</p>
<p>JACK provides clock synchronization and is not concerned with time code
(this is not entirely true, more on jack-transport later). On the
software side, jackd provides sample-accurate synchronization between
all JACK applications. On the hardware side, JACK uses the clock of the
audio-interface. Synchronization of multiple interfaces requires
hardware support to sync the clocks. If two interfaces run at different
clocks the only way to align the signals is via re-sampling (SRC—Sample
Rate Conversion), which is expensive in terms of CPU usage and may
decrease fidelity if done incorrectly.</p>
<p>Timecode is used to align systems already synchronized by a clock to a
common point in time, this is application specific and various standards
and methods exist to do this.</p>
<p>To make things confusing, there are possibilities to synchronize clocks
using timecode. e.g. using mechanism called jam-sync and a phase-locked
loop.</p>
<p>An interesting point to note is that LTC (Linear Time Code) is a
Manchester encoded, frequency modulated signal that carries both clock
and time. It is possible to extract absolute position data and speed
from it.</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="latency-and-latency-compensation">7.2 - Latency and Latency-Compensation</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latency_%28audio%29">Latency</a> is a
system’s reaction time to a given stimulus. There are many factors that
contribute to the total latency of a system. In order to achieve exact
time synchronization all sources of latency need to be taken into
account and compensated for.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="sources-of-latency">Sources of Latency</p>
<p class="rubric" id="sound-propagation-through-the-air">Sound propagation through the air</p>
<p>Since sound is a mechanical perturbation in a fluid, it travels at
comparatively slow
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_sound">speed</a> of about 340
m/s. As a consequence, an acoustic guitar or piano has a latency of
about 1–2&nbsp;ms, due to the propagation time of the sound between the
instrument and the player’s ear.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="digital-to-analog-and-analog-to-digital-conversion">Digital-to-Analog and Analog-to-Digital conversion</p>
<p>Electric signals travel quite fast (on the order of the speed of light),
so their propagation time is negligible in this context. But the
conversions between the analog and digital domain take a comparatively
long time to perform, so their contribution to the total latency may be
considerable on otherwise very low-latency systems. Conversion delay is
usually below 1&nbsp;ms.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="digital-signal-processing">Digital Signal Processing</p>
<p>Digital processors tend to process audio in chunks, and the size of that
chunk depends on the needs of the algorithm and performance/cost
considerations. This is usually the main cause of latency when using a
computer and the one that can be predicted and optimized.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="computer-io-architecture">Computer I/O Architecture</p>
<p>A computer is a general purpose processor, not a digital audio
processor. This means the audio data has to jump a lot of fences in its
path from the outside to the CPU and back, contending in the process
with some other parts of the system vying for the same resources (CPU
time, bus bandwidth, etc.)</p>
<p class="rubric" id="the-latency-chain">The Latency chain</p>
<div class="figure" id="id473">
<img alt="Latency chain" src="_images/latency-chain.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Latency chain</span></p>
</div>
<p>The numbers are an example for a typical PC. With professional gear and
an optimized system the total round-trip latency is usually lower. The
important point is that latency is always additive and a sum of many
independent factors.</p>
<p>Processing latency is usually divided into capture latency (the time it
takes for the digitized audio to be available for digital processing,
usually one audio period), and playback latency (the time it takes for
In practice, the combination of both matters. It is called round-trip
latency: the time necessary for a certain audio event to be captured,
processed and played back.</p>
<p>It is important to note that processing latency in a jackd is a matter
of choice. It can be lowered within the limits imposed by the hardware
(audio device, CPU and bus speed) and audio driver. Lower latencies
increase the load on the system because it needs to process the audio in
smaller chunks which arrive much more frequently. The lower the latency,
the more likely the system will fail to meet its processing deadline and
the dreaded xrun (short for buffer over- or under-run) will make its
appearance more often, leaving its merry trail of clicks, pops and
crackles.</p>
<p>The digital I/O latency is usually negligible for integrated or PCI
audio devices, but for USB or FireWire interfaces the bus clocking and
buffering can add some milliseconds.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="low-latency-use-cases">Low Latency use cases</p>
<p>Low latency is <strong>not</strong> always a feature one wants to have. It comes with
a couple of drawbacks: the most prominent is increased power consumption
because the CPU needs to process many small chunks of audio data, it is
constantly active and can not enter power-saving mode (think fan noise).
Since each application that is part of the signal chain must run in
every audio cycle, low-latency systems will undergo context switches
between applications more often, which incur a significant overhead.
This results in a much higher system load and an increased chance of
xruns.</p>
<p>For a few applications, low latency is critical:</p>
<p class="rubric" id="playing-virtual-instruments">Playing virtual instruments</p>
<p>A large delay between the pressing of the keys and the sound the
instrument produces will throw off the timing of most instrumentalists
(save church organists, whom we believe to be awesome
latency-compensation organic systems.)</p>
<p class="rubric" id="software-audio-monitoring">Software audio monitoring</p>
<p>If a singer is hearing her own voice through two different paths, her
head bones and headphones, even small latencies can be very disturbing
and manifest as a tinny, irritating sound.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="live-effects">Live effects</p>
<p>Low latency is important when using the computer as an effect rack for
inline effects such as compression or EQ. For reverbs, slightly higher
latency might be tolerable, if the direct sound is not routed through
the computer.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="live-mixing">Live mixing</p>
<p>Some sound engineers use a computer for mixing live performances.
Basically that is a combination of the above: monitoring on stage,
effects processing and EQ.</p>
<p>In many other cases, such as playback, recording, overdubbing, mixing,
mastering, etc. latency is not important, since it can easily be
compensated for.</p>
<p>To explain that statement: During mixing or mastering, one doesn’t care
if it takes 10ms or 100ms between the instant the play button is pressed
and the sound coming from the speaker. The same is true when recording
with a count in.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="latency-compensation">Latency compensation</p>
<p>During tracking it is important that the sound that is currently being
played back is internally aligned with the sound that is being recorded.</p>
<p>This is where latency compensation comes into play. There are two ways
to compensate for latency in a DAW, read-ahead and write-behind. The DAW
starts playing a bit early (relative to the playhead), so that when the
sound arrives at the speakers a short time later, it is exactly aligned
with the material that is being recorded. Since we know that playback
has latency, the incoming audio can be delayed by the same amount to
line things up again.</p>
<p>The second approach is prone to various implementation issues regarding
timecode and transport synchronization. Ardour uses read-ahead to
compensate for latency. The time displayed in the Ardour clock
corresponds to the audio signal that is heared on the speakers (and is
not where Ardour reads files from disk).</p>
<p>As a side note, this is also one of the reasons why many projects start
at timecode 01:00:00:00. When compensating for output latency the DAW
will need to read data from before the start of the session, so that the
audio arrives in time at the output when the timecode hits 01:00:00:00.
Ardour does handle the case of 00:00:00:00 properly but not all
systems/software/hardware that you may inter-operate with may behave the
same.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="latency-compensation-and-clock-sync">Latency Compensation And Clock Sync</p>
<p>To achieve sample accurate timecode synchronization, the latency
introduced by the audio setup needs to be known and compensated for.</p>
<p>In order to compensate for latency, JACK or JACK applications need to
know exactly how long a certain signal needs to be read-ahead or
delayed:</p>
<div class="figure" id="id474">
<img alt="Jack Latency Compensation" src="_images/jack-latency-excerpt.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Jack Latency Compensation</span></p>
</div>
<p>In the figure above, clients A and B need to be able to answer the
following two questions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>How long has it been since the data read from port Ai or Bi arrived
at the edge of the JACK graph (capture)?</li>
<li>How long will it be until the data written to port Ao or Bo arrives
at the edge of the JACK graph (playback)?</li>
</ul>
<p>JACK features an API that allows applications to determine the answers
to above questions. However JACK can not know about the additional
latency that is introduced by the computer architecture, operating
system and soundcard. These values can be specified by the JACK command
line parameters -I and -O and vary from system to system but are
constant on each. On a general purpose computer system the only way to
accurately learn about the total (additional) latency is to measure it.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="calibrating-jack-latency">Calibrating JACK Latency</p>
<p>Linux DSP guru Fons Adriaensen wrote a tool called jack_delay to
accurately measure the round-trip latency of a closed loop audio chain,
with sub-sample accuracy. JACK itself includes a variant of this tool
called jack_iodelay.</p>
<p>Jack_iodelay allows to measure the total latency of the system,
subtracts the known latency of JACK itself and suggests values for
jackd’s audio-backend parameters.</p>
<p>jack_[io]delay works by emitting some rather annoying tones, capturing
them again after a round trip through the whole chain, and measuring the
difference in phase so it can estimate with great accuracy the time
taken.</p>
<p>The loop can be closed in a number of ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Putting a speaker close to a microphone. This is rarely done, as air
propagation latency is well known so there is no need to measure it.</li>
<li>Connecting the output of the audio interface to its input using a
patch cable. This can be an analog or a digital loop, depending on
the nature of the input/output used. A digital loop will not factor
in the AD/DA converter latency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the loop has been closed, one must:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Launch jackd with the configuration to test.</li>
<li>Launch jack_delay on the command line.</li>
<li>Make the appropriate connections between the jack ports so the loop
is closed.</li>
<li>Adjust the playback and capture levels in the mixer.</li>

as well as JACK-transport, a JACK-specific timecode implementation.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Ardour can generate timecode and thus act as timecode master,

<div class="line">Combining the timecode slave and generator modes, Ardour can also
translate timecode. e.g create LTC timecode from incoming MTC.</div>
</div>
<p class="rubric" id="ardour-timecode-configuration">Ardour Timecode Configuration</p>
<p>Each Ardour session has a specific timecode frames-per-second setting
which is configured in session &gt; properties &gt; timecode. The selected
timecode affects the timecode ruler in the main window as well as the
clock itself.</p>
<p>Note that some timecode formats do not support all of Ardour’s available
fps settings. MTC is limited to 24, 25, 29.97 and 30 fps.</p>
<p>The video pull-up modes change the effective samplerate of Ardour to
allow for changing a film soundtrack from one frame rate to another. The
concept is beyond the scope of this manual, but Wikipedia’s entry on
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecine">Telecine</a> may be a good
start.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="ardour-timecode-generator-configuration">Ardour Timecode Generator Configuration</p>
<p>This is pretty straightforward: simply turn it on. The MTC and
MIDI-Clock generator do not have any options. The LTC generator has a
configurable output level. JACK-transport cannot be <em>generated</em>. Jack
itself is always synced to its own cycle and cannot do varispeed—it will
always be synced to a hardware clock or another JACK master.</p>
<p>The relevant settings for timecode generator can be found in Edit &gt;
Preferences &gt; MIDI Preferences (for MTC, MC) and Edit &gt; Preferences &gt;
Transport Preferences (for LTC).</p>
<p>The timecode is sent to jack-ports <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ardour:MTC</span> <span class="pre">out</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ardour:MIDI</span> <span class="pre">clock</span> <span class="pre">out</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ardour:LTC-out</span></code>. Multiple generators
can be active simultaneously.</p>
<p>Note that, as of Jan 2014, only the LTC generator supports latency
compensation. This is due to the fact the Ardour MIDI ports are not yet
latency compensated.</p>
<p>In Session &gt; Properties, it is possible to define an offset between
Ardour’s internal time and the timecode sent. Currently only the LTC
generator honors this offset.</p>
<p>Both LTC and MTC are limited to 30&nbsp;fps. Using frame rates larger than
that will disable the generator. In both cases also only 24, 25, 29.97df
(drop-frame) and 30&nbsp;fps are well defined by specifications (such as
SMPTE-12M, EU and the MIDI standard).</p>
<p class="rubric" id="mtc-generator">MTC Generator</p>
<p>The MTC generator has no options. Ardour sends full MTC frames whenever
the transport is relocated or changes state (start/stop). MTC quarter
frames are sent when the transport is rolling and the transport speed is
within 93% and 107%.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="ltc-generator">LTC Generator</p>
<p>The level of the LTC generator output signal can be configured in in the
Preferences &gt; Transport dialog. By default it is set to -18&nbsp;dBFS, which
corresponds to 0dBu in an EBU calibrated system.</p>
<p>The LTC generator has an additional option to keep sending timecode even
when the transport is stopped. This mode is intended to drive analog
tape machines which unspool the tape if no LTC timecode is received.</p>
<p>LTC is send regardless of Ardour’s transport speed. It is accurately
generated even for very slow speeds (&lt;5%) and only limited by the
soundcard’s sampling-rate and filter (see <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_phenomenon#Signal_processing_explanation">Gibbs
phenomenon</a>)
for high speeds.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="ardour-slave-configuration">Ardour Slave Configuration</p>
<p>The timecode source can be switched with the button just right of
Ardour’s main clock. By default it is set to Internal in which case
Ardour will ignore any external timecode. The button allows to toggle
between Internal and the configured timecode source which is chosen in
Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Transport.</p>
<p>When Ardour is chasing (synchronizing to) an external timecode source,
the following cases need to be distinguished:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>the timecode source shares the clock</li>
<li>the timecode source is independent (no wordclock sync)</li>
</ol>
<p>and</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>the timecode source uses the same FPS setting as Ardour</li>
<li>the timecode source runs at different frames-per-second</li>
</ol>
<p>In both cases the first option is preferred: clock sync + same FPS
setting.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="frames-per-second">Frames-per-second</p>
<p>If the frames-per-second do not match, Ardour can either re-calculate
and map the frames, or the configured FPS (Session &gt; Properties) can be
changed automatically while the slave is active. The behavior is
configured with the checkbox Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Transport &gt; Match
session video frame rate to external timecode.</p>
<p>When enabled, the session video frame rate will be changed to match that
of the selected external timecode source. When disabled, the session
video frame rate will not be changed to match that of the selected
external timecode source. Instead the frame rate indication in the main
clock will flash red, and Ardour will convert between the external
timecode standard and the session standard.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">29.97 drop-frame timecode is another corner case. While the SMPTE
12M-1999 specifies 29.97df as 30000/1001 frames per second, not all
hardware devices follow that standard. The checkbox Lock to 29.9700
fps instead of 30000/1001 allows to use a compatibility mode for those
devices.</div>
<div class="line">When enabled, the external timecode source is assumed to use 29.970000
fps instead of 30000/1001. SMPTE 12M-1999 specifies 29.97df as
30000/1001. The spec further mentions that drop-frame timecode has an
accumulated error of -86&nbsp;ms over a 24-hour period. Drop-frame timecode
would compensate exactly for a NTSC color frame rate of 30 * 0.9990
(ie 29.970000). That is <em>not</em> the actual rate. However, some vendors
use that rate—despite it being against the specs—because the variant
of using exactly 29.97 fps yields zero timecode drift.</div>
</div>
<p class="rubric" id="clock-sync-lock">Clock Sync Lock</p>
<p>As described in the <a class="reference external" href="http://manual.ardour.org/synchronization/on-clock-and-time/">On Clock and
Time</a>
chapter, timecode and clock are independent. If the external timecode
source is not in sample-sync with the audio hardware (and JACK), Ardour
needs to run at varispeed to adjust for the discrepancy.</p>
<p>The checkbox External timecode is sync locked allows to select the
behavior according to the setup. When enabled, it indicates that the
selected external timecode source shares sync (Black &amp; Burst, Wordclock,
etc) with the audio interface.</p>
<p>In other words: if enabled, Ardour will only perform initial
synchronization and keep playing at speed 1.0 instead of vari-speed
adjusting to compensate for drift.</p>
<p>Note that vari-speed is unavailable when recording in Ardour, and all
tracking happens at speed 1.0. So in order to record in sync with
external timecode it must be sample-locked or it will drift over time.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="midi-clock">MIDI Clock</p>
<p>MIDI Clock is not a timecode format but tempo-based time. The absolute
reference point is expressed as beats-per-minute and Bar, Beat and Tick.
There is no concept of sample-locking for MIDI clock signals. Ardour
will vari-speed if necessary to chase the incoming signal.</p>
<p>Note that the MIDI Clock source must be connected to the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ardour:MIDI</span> <span class="pre">clock</span> <span class="pre">in</span></code> port.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="ltclinear-timecode">LTC—Linear Timecode</p>
<p>The LTC slave decodes an incoming LTC signal on a JACK audio port. It
will auto-detect the frame rate and start locking to the signal once two
consecutive LTC frames have been received.</p>
<p>The incoming timecode signal needs to arrive at the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ardour:LTC-in</span></code>
port. Port-connections are restored for each session and the preference
dialog offers an option to select it for all sessions.</p>
<p>Ardour’s transport is aligned to LTC-frame start/end positions according
to the SMPTE 12M-1999 specification, which means that the first bit of
an LTC-Frame is aligned to different Lines of a Video-Frame, depending
on the TV standard used. Only for Film (24fps) does the LTC-Frame
directly match the video Frame boundaries.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id475">
<img alt="LTC frame alignment for the 525/60 TV standard" src="_images/ltc-transport-alignment.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">LTC frame alignment for the 525/60 TV standard</span></p>
</div>
<p>Ardour supports vari-speed and backwards playback but will only follow
speed changes if the sync locked option is disabled.</p>
<p>While Ardour is chasing LTC, the main transport clock will display the
received Timecode as well as the delta between the incoming signal and
Ardour’s transport position.</p>
<p>A global offset between incoming timecode and Ardour’s transport can be
configured in Session &gt; Properties.</p>
<p>The user-bits in the received LTC frame are ignored.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="mtcmidi-timecode">MTC—MIDI Timecode</p>
<p>Ardour’s MTC slave parses full timecode messages as well as MTC
quarter-frame messages arriving on the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ardour:MTC</span> <span class="pre">in</span></code> port. The
transport will only start rolling once a complete sequence of 8 quarter
frames has been received.</p>
<p>Ardour supports vari-speed and backwards playback but will only follow
MTC speed changes if the sync locked option is disabled.</p>
<p>When Ardour is chasing MTC, the main transport clock will display the
received Timecode as well as the delta between the incoming signal and
Ardour’s transport position.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="jack-transport">JACK Transport</p>
<p>When slaved to jack, Ardour’s transport will be identical to
JACK-transport. As opposed to other slaves, Ardour can be used to
control the JACK transport states (stopped/rolling). No port connections
need to be made for jack-transport to work.</p>
<p>JACK-transport does not support vari-speed, nor offsets. Ardour does not
chase the timecode but is always in perfect sample-sync with it.</p>
<p>JACK-transport also includes temp-based-time information in
Bar:Beats:Ticks and beats-per-minute. However, only one JACK application
can provide this information at a given time. The checkbox Session &gt;
Properties &gt; JACK Time Master configures Ardour to act as translator
from timecode to BBT information.</p>

<li>External Synchronization<ul>
<li>External timecode source determines which external source to use
when Ardour is using an external
<a class="reference external" href="#working-with-synchronization">synchronization</a> source.
Depending on the timecode source chosen, the additional preference
options below are available.</li>
<li>Match session video frame rate to external timecode controls the
value of the video frame rate <em>while chasing</em> an external timecode
source. When enabled, the session video frame rate will be changed
to match that of the selected external timecode source. When
disabled, the session video frame rate will not be changed to
match that of the selected external timecode source. Instead, the
frame rate indication in the main clock will flash red and Ardour
will convert between the external timecode standard and the
session standard.</li>
<li>Sync-lock timecode to clock (disable drift compensation) When
enabled, Ardour will never varispeed when slaved to external
timecode. Sync Lock indicates that the selected external timecode
source shares clock-sync (Black &amp; Burst, Wordclock, etc) with the
audio interface. This options disables drift compensation. The
transport speed is fixed at 1.0. Vari-speed LTC will be ignored
and cause drift. When disabled, Ardour will compensate for
potential drift regardless if the timecode sources shares clock
sync.</li>
<li>Lock to 29.9700 fps instead of 30000/1001, when enabled, will
force Ardour to assume the external timecode source uses 29.97 fps
instead of 30000/1001. SMPTE 12M-1999 specifies 29.97&nbsp;df as
30000/1001. The spec further mentions that drop-frame timecode has
an accumulated error of -86&nbsp;ms over a 24&nbsp;hour period. Drop-frame
timecode would compensate exactly for an NTSC color frame rate of
30 × 0.9990 (i.e. 29.970000). That is not the actual rate.
However, some vendors use that rate—despite it being against the
specs—because the variant of using exactly 29.97&nbsp;fps has zero
timecode drift.</li>

support some types of plugins and not others. While this documentation
tries to show all possible options, most systems will only show a subset
of the options hereunder, e.g. AudioUnits are macOS only…</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Scan/Discover<ul>
<li>Scan for Plugins will initiate an immediate scan of the system for
available plugins. Useful to get a newly installed plugin
recognised by Ardour.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>General<ul>
<li>Always Display Plugin Scan Progress When enabled a popup window
showing plugin scan progress is displayed for indexing (cache
load) and discovery (detect new plugins).</li>
<li>Silence plugins when the transport is stopped when stopping
playback or recording, if this option is checked, the plugins that
still emit sound (reverbs, etc…) will be stopped. If unchecked,
the plugins will continue playing after the transport stop.</li>
<li>Make new plugins active when enabled, any plugin added to a track
will be in active mode. If unchecked, the plugins will be added in
inactive mode by default, hence have no processing effect on the
track/bus.</li>
<li>Limit automatable parameters per plugin: as some plugins
(synthesizers, …) have a lot of parameters, and those parameters
can be automated by Ardour, checking this will limit the number of
parameters that are listed as automatable, hence making the lists
shorter and the GUI more responsive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Plugin GUI<ul>
<li>Automatically open the plugin GUI when adding a new plugin shows
the plugins GUI as soon as it is added to the processing box. If
unchecked, the plugin will be added in the processor box but the
GUI will only be shown when double clicking it.</li>
<li>Show Plugin Inline Display on Mixer strip by default allows Ardour
to show, in the <a class="reference external" href="#audiomidi-mixer-strips">mixer strips</a>, a
visual rendering of the effect. These Inline Display are a special
feature of Ardour, so not all plugins are able to show this
display. Most of Ardour’s <a class="reference external" href="#plugins-bundled-with-ardour">own
plugins</a> have an Inline Display.
At any time, the plugin’s Inline Display can be toggled on or off
by double-clicking it.</li>
<li>Don’t automatically open the plugin GUI when the plugin has an
inline display mode: this option, available only if Automatically
open the plugin GUI when adding a new plugin is checked,
supercedes it and hides the plugin GUI at creation if it has an
Inline Display, like Ardour’s own <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a-*</span></code> plugins.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instrument<ul>
<li>Ask to replace existing instrument plugin: if a MIDI track already
has an instrument (i.e. MIDI to audio converter of some sort) and
this option is checked, Ardour will detect it and offer to replace
the existing instrument with the newly added one, avoiding a
possible conflict.</li>
<li>Interactively configure instrument plugins on insert: when

type “Dialog” for all floating windows instead of using type
“Utility” for some of them. This may help usability with some

<p>On Linux systems, QJackCtl control software displays ALSA MIDI ports

<p class="rubric" id="jack-midi-configuration">JACK MIDI Configuration</p>
<p>By default, JACK will <strong>not</strong> automatically detect and use existing MIDI
ports. One of several ways of bridging between the native MIDI

described in the following sections.</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="midi-on-linux">10.1 - MIDI on Linux</p>

<p class="rubric" id="using-a2jmidid">Using a2jmidid</p>
<p>a2jmidid is an application that bridges between the system MIDI ports
and JACK.</p>
<p>First it must be ensured that there is no ALSA sequencer support enabled
in JACK. To check that, one must open QJackCtl’s Setup window and set
Settings &gt; MIDI Driver to none, then uncheck the Misc &gt; Enable ALSA
Sequencer support option. The jack server must then be restarted before
going on.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="checking-for-a2jmidid-availability">Checking for a2jmidid availability</p>
<p>Next, it must be checked whether a2jmidid is already installed. This is
done by starting the JACK server, then going to the command line and
typing:</p>
<p>a2jmidid -e
If a2jmidid does not exist, it must be installed with the software
manager of the Linux distribution in use until this command responds.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="checking-available-midi-ports">Checking available MIDI ports</p>
<p>If JACK is correctly configured for MIDI, then the MIDI ports should

<p>Once it has been verified that the ports appear in JACK as expected,
this can be made to happen whenever JACK is started:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If a newer version of JACK 1 is in use, by just making sure the

<li>For other versions of JACK, by adding <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a2jmidid</span> <span class="pre">-e</span> <span class="pre">&amp;</span></code> as an “after

description.
The Editor and the Mixer share the same toolbar (the top of the window).
The sections displayed in this toolbar can be customized to the user’s
workflow, by checking options in Preferences &gt; Appearance &gt; Toolbar.</p>
<p>Switching between the Editor and the Mixer windows is done:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>with the <a class="reference external" href="#other-toolbar-items">Mode Selector buttons</a> in the
upper right</li>
<li>with the M shortcut</li>
<li>with the menu Window &gt; Editor <em>(or Mixer)</em> &gt; Show.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both windows can be visible at the same time (e.g. for a multi-monitor
setup) using Window &gt; Editor <em>(or Mixer)</em> &gt; Detach option in the same
submenu.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="the-editor">The Editor</p>
<p>The Editor window includes the editor track canvas where audio and MIDI
data can be arranged along a timeline. This is the window where editing
and arranging a project is done. The window has a general “horizontal”
sense to it: the timeline flows from left to right, the playhead showing
the current position in the session moves from left to right—the window
really represents time in a fairly literal way.</p>
<p>It is possible to show a single channel strip in the editor window, and
some people find this enough to work on mixing without actually opening
the mixer window. Most of the time though, both of these windows will be
needed at various stages of a session’s lifetime.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="the-mixer">The Mixer</p>
<p>The Mixer window represents signal flow and is the window that will
probably be used most when mixing a session. It includes channel strips
for each track and bus in the session. It has a general “vertical” sense
to it: signals flow from the top of each channel strip through the
processing elements in the strip to reach the output listed at the
bottom.</p>
<p>To learn more about the process of mixing, see
<a class="reference external" href="#basic-mixing">Mixing</a>.</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="main-menu">12 - Main Menu</p>
<p>The Main Menu is made of 8 menus that allow the user to interact with
Ardour, and below is a reference of all the menu actions.</p>
<p>Notice that a lot of this menus, and probably all of the most used ones
have keyboard shortcuts to ease and fasten the work. A sum-up of these
shortcuts can be found on the <a class="reference external" href="#default-keyboard-bindings">Defaults Keyboard
Bindings</a> page, and every menu in Ardour
can be reassigned to an user defined key binding, or used via
<a class="reference external" href="#controlling-ardour-with-osc">OSC</a> with a control surface.</p>

<p>The buffers are labelled as p for playback and c for capture. If the
system is fast enough, these buffers should be 100% full at all times,
showing the system has time to precompute all the data before delivering
it to the audio system. A buffer constantly under 20% is a sign of an
underpowered computer system or of too much processing.</p>
<p>An Xrun (short for buffer over- or under-run) happens when the system

<p>If Ardour is synchronized with other devices then some or all of these
control methods may be unavailable—depending on the synchronization
protocol, Ardour may respond only to commands sent from its master
device(s).</p>
<p>Under these buttons is the Shuttle Speed Control that allows to scrub
through the audio quickly. The slider decides the playback speed: the
further from the center it is set, the faster the playback will scrub in
both directions.</p>
<p>The Shuttle Speed Control supports 2 operating modes, that can be chosen
with right click &gt; Mode:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Sprung mode that allows for a temporary scrub: it only scrubs while
the mouse is left clicked on the control.</li>
<li>Wheel mode that allows to set a playback speed until the “Stop”
button is pressed, which stops the playback and resets its speed.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the left of the slider is the positional sync button (which might
show Internal, or MTC or several other values), than can be used to
control whether or not the transport position and start is controlled by
Ardour, or by an external positional synchronization source, such as
MIDI Time Code (MTC), Linear Time Code (LTC) or JACK (see <a class="reference external" href="#timecode-generators-and-slaves">Timecode

<img alt="The transport clocks in Ardour" src="_images/new_main_clocks.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The transport clocks in Ardour</span></p>
</div>
<p>Clocks in Ardour are used to display time values precisely. In many
cases, they are also one way to edit (change) time values, and in a few
cases, the only way. All clocks share the same basic appearance and
functionality, which is described below, but a few clocks serve
particularly important roles.</p>
<p>In the transport bar of the editor window there are two clocks (on a
large enough screen), that display the current position of the playhead
and additional information related to transport control and the
timeline. These are called the transport clocks; the left one is the
primary transport clock and the right one is the secondary transport
clock.</p>
<p>All the clocks in Ardour share the same powerful way of editing time.
Refer to <a class="reference external" href="#editing-clocks">Editing Clocks</a> to learn how.</p>
<p>Editing the time in the transport clocks will reposition the playhead in
the same way that various other editing operations will.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="the-special-role-of-the-secondary-transport-clock">The Special Role of the Secondary Transport Clock</p>
<p>On a few occasions Ardour needs to display time values to the user, but
there is no obvious way to specify what units to use. The most common
case is the big cursor that appears when dragging regions. For this and
other similar cases, Ardour will display time using the same units as
the secondary clock.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="why-are-there-two-transport-clocks">Why are there two transport clocks?</p>
<p>Having two transport clocks allows seeing the playhead position in two
different time units without having to change any settings. For example,
one can see the playhead position in both timecode units and BBT time.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="special-modes-for-the-transport-clocks">Special Modes for the Transport Clocks</p>
<p>In addition to the time-unit modes, each of the two transport clocks
(again, on a sufficiently large screen) can be independently set to
display Delta to Edit Point in whatever time units its current mode
indicates. This setting means that the clock shows the distance between
the playhead and the current edit point, and it may show a positive or
negative value depending on the temporal order of these two points. The
clocks will use a different color when in this mode to avoid confusion.</p>
<p>To switch either (or both!) of the transport clocks into this mode, use
Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Transport and select the relevant checkboxes.</p>
<p>Note that when in Delta to Edit Point mode, the transport clocks cannot
be edited.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="the-big-clock">The Big Clock</p>
<p>To show the current playhead position in a big, resizable window,
activate Window &gt; Big Clock. The big clock is very useful when working
away from the screen but still wanting to see the playhead position
clearly (such as when working with a remote control device across a
room). The big clock will change its visual appearance to indicate when
active recording is taking place. Below on the left is a screenshot
showing a fairly large big clock window filling a good part of the
display, and on the right, the same clock during active recording.</p>

<div class="figure" id="id499">
<img alt="Editor toolbar's grid." src="_images/toolbar-grid.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Editor toolbar’s grid.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Ardour’s editor utilizes a grid to assist in the placement of regions on
the timeline, or with editing functions that need to happen at a
specific point in time. This snapping of the cursor and various objects
to the grid can be toggled on or off, as does its behaviour, and grid
units.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="about-snapping">About Snapping</p>
<p>There are two ways to think about aligning material to a grid. The first
and most obvious one is where an object’s position is clamped to grid
lines. In Ardour, this is called absolute snap and is commonly used when
working with sampled material where audio begins exactly at the
beginning of a file, note or region.</p>
<p>The second, relative snap, is used when an object’s position relative to
the grid lines is important. In music, this allows to move objects
around without changing the “feel” (or timing) of a performance.</p>
<p>Absolute snap is the default method of snapping in Ardour.</p>
<p>While dragging objects, pressing the absolute snap modifier key(s)
switches from absolute to relative snap.</p>
<p>The snap can also be entirely disabled by using the snap modifier (see
below).</p>
<p>Note that in relative snap mode the reference point is taken to be the
distance to the nearest grid line.</p>
<p>Note also that when an object lies exactly on a grid line, there will be
no difference between relative and absolute snap modes.</p>
<p>The relative snap and snap modifiers (along with other modifier keys)
may be set in Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; User Interaction</p>
<p>For common use patterns, it is recommended to assign a unique key for
one snap modifier and two keys for the other in such a way that they
share an otherwise unused key. For example, the snap modifier may be
chosen to be the key and the relative snap modifier to be the and keys.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="snap-modes">Snap Modes</p>
<p>Using the above modifications, Ardour supports three different modes of
snapping to the grid:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>No Grid</td>
<td>disables the grid. All objects
move freely in this mode. In No
Grid mode, the grid may be
temporarily activated by pressing
the snap modifier (for absolute
snap) or switch to relative snap
by pressing the relative snap
modifier.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Grid</td>
<td>activates normal snapping. All
positions of objects snap to the
grid. (See <a class="reference external" href="#gridunits">Grid
Units</a> below to
change the grid). Moving an
object in “Grid”-mode, does not
change its position until the
mouse is far enough for the
object to reach the next grid
line. To maintain an objects’
position relative to the grid
line, the “snap relative”
modifier can be used. When
holding down this modifier during
a drag, the dragged object will
jump while maintaining its
original distance from the line.
New objects will always be
created at grid points. Holding
down the snap modifier will
disable the current grid setting
and allow moving the object
freely.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Magnetic</td>
<td>is a less strict type of
snapping. Objects can still be
moved to any position, but
positions close to the relative
or absolute grid points will
snap. In order to move an object
very close to a snap point, it
may be necessary to zoom in to
prevent snapping to that point,
or to use the snap modifier to
disable snap completely. As with
Grid mode, the snap modifier will
disable snap completely while the
absolute snap modifier will move
the “notch” of Magnetic snap to
the grid lines.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="rubric" id="syncing-regions-to-the-grid">Syncing Regions to the Grid</p>
<p>By default, a region’s beginning will be used as the reference for both
types of snapping, this behaviour can be changed by setting a sync point
in the region, by selecting the region(s) and pressing V. This will set
the sync point to the current <a class="reference external" href="#edit-point-control">edit point</a>.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="gridunits">Grid Units</p>

<p>To use Region starts/ends/syncs/bounds as snap choices, it is necessary
to have either:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>No</em> tracks selected, which means that Ardour snaps to regions on any
track, or</li>
<li>Several tracks selected, which means that Ardour only snaps to
regions on those selected tracks.</li>
</ul>
<p>If items are moved on a track, and only the current track is selected,
then snapping will only happen with other regions on the same track.
This means that enabling Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Editor &gt; Link Selections
of Regions and Tracks will make the “Region” grid unit unusable. This
option should not be used in conjunction with the use any of the Region
grid units.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Editor toolbar’s Edit Point</span></p>
</div>
<p>Editing operations in a Digital Audio Workstation like Ardour can be
broken down according to how many points on the timeline are required to
carry the operation out. Splitting a region for example, requires just
one position on the timeline (the one where the split will happen).
Cutting out a time range requires two positions, one for the start of
the cut and one for the end.</p>
<p>In Ardour the edit point is the location where most single-point editing
operations take place. It can be set to either of the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the Playhead position</li>
<li>the selected (or “active”) Marker</li>
<li>the position of the Mouse (or touch) pointer</li>
</ul>
<p>The default edit point is the location of the pointer.</p>
<p>There are two keybindings available to cycle through the edit point
options. The most common workflow tends to involve switching back and
forth between the playhead and mouse as the edit point. Pressing the
grave accent key ` switches between these two. Using ` cycles through
all three choices (including the selected marker). The edit point can
also be switched using the combo-selector just right of the snap/grid
unit selector.</p>

<p>The Ranges &amp; Marks List is a tab in the Editor Lists area on the right
of the Editor window. If the editor list area isn’t visible it can be
enabled by checking View &gt; Show Editor List. The Ranges &amp; Marks list can
be used as a single point of control for all range and location markers
(including the punch and loop ranges), or as a supplement to other
methods of working with them.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="common-elements">Common elements</p>
<p>Each section has a set of editable <a class="reference external" href="#editing-clocks">clock widgets</a>
which display the location of a marker, or the start, end, and duration
times of a range, respectively.</p>
<p>The Use PH buttons allows to set the corresponding clock to the current
playhead position. A Middle click on any of the clocks will move the
playhead to that location. Both functions are also available from the
clock context menus.</p>
<p>Right clicking on any of the clocks brings up a context menu that allows
changing of the display between Timecode, Bars:Beats, Minutes:Seconds,
and Samples.</p>
<p>The — (subtract) button in front of each user-defined range or marker in
the list allows that particular item to be removed. The name fields of
custom ranges and markers can be edited.</p>
<p>The Hide checkboxes make markers and ranges invisible on the respective
ruler to reduce visual clutter; the markers remain active however, and
can be used normally.</p>
<p>Selecting Lock prevents the respective marker from being moved until
unlocked. Where applicable, Glue fixes the marker position relative to
the current musical position expressed in bars and beats, rather than
the absolute time. This will make the respective marker follow changes
in the tempo map.</p>

things that are not listed in the menu above, or connect to multiple
sources at once, reduce the number of inputs, etc…</p>
<p>On audio tracks, is a Trim knob, as on traditional consoles. It set the
base input level for the track, avoiding any clipping. Notice that it
trims both any input, but (when playing back), also the level of the
playlist as displayed in the Editor. It makes sense as while playing,
the input of the track is the playlist, on which the mixer strip acts.</p>
<p>On midi tracks, it is replaced by a MIDI Input button, that
allows/disallows MIDI input on the track.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="polarity">Polarity</p>
<p>On audio tracks only, the Polarity button(s), 1 per input, allow to
reverse the signal, i.e. a negative value will be positive and
vice-versa. This can help deal with phasing issues.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="processor-box">Processor box</p>
<p>The processor box is where the effects are added. By default, one effect
is always present: the Fader (see below). The effects can be added
<em>pre</em>-fader and appear in brown, or <em>post</em>-fader, where they will appear
in dark green. The signal flow is represented by lines, red for the MIDI
and green for the audio.</p>
<p>It is also where the <a class="reference external" href="#aux-sends">Sends</a> come from, whether external

<p class="rubric" id="recording-options">Recording options</p>
<p>The most noticeable button here is the Record Enable one, with a red
circle. When enabled, next time the Global record will be armed and
playback started, everything that comes from the input of the track will
be recorded. Right clicking a disabled record button allows to enable
Rec-Safe, thus protecting the track against accidental recording.</p>
<p>The buttons on the right, In and Disk, show what the user is listening
to by lighting up, between the <em>In</em>put and the actual content of the
playlist on <em>Disk</em>.</p>
<p>They also allow to override the automatic switching by pressing them to
lock one source or the other to be what the user is hearing.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="mutesolo">Mute/Solo</p>
<p>These buttons allow to Mute (or silence) the track, or Solo them,
shutting down the gain of the other tracks (totally by default, can be
set to partially in the options). See <a class="reference external" href="#muting-and-soloing">Muting and
Soloing</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Notice that by default, Solo overrides Mute, i.e. if a track is both
Soloed and Muted, it will play. That can be changed in the preferences.</p>
<p>The two led button above are related to solo:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Solo Isolate, as the name suggests, isolates tracks or busses from
the solo system. When tracks or busses are soloed the isolated ones
will not mute.</li>
<li>Solo Lock locks the solo into its current state (i.e. solo on or solo
off). It will not allow the solo state to be changed until the lock
is released.</li>
</ul>
<p class="rubric" id="gain-meter">Gain &amp; Meter</p>
<p>On the right of this part is a <a class="reference external" href="#metering-in-ardour">Meter</a>,
displaying the level of the track’s output after the fader. In can be
set to display the signal at any point, see below <em>Metering Point</em>.
Right clicking this meter shows a menu allowing to switch the meter
type.</p>
<p>The big Gain slider on the left allows to change the gain of the track.
Its default OdB value is reminded with a white horizontal line, and its
precise value is shown in a text field above it, that doubles as a way
to type in a numeric value.</p>
<p>The text field above the meter shows the “Peak”, i.e. the maximum value
that has been reached during playback. To avoid distortion, the value
should stay below OdB, and if it goes above this value, the text field
will turn red. Clicking on this field will reset the Peak value (for a
new measurement or a new part of the track).</p>
<p>Notice that if any gain automation has been set and the automation state
is set on “Play” (see below), then the Gain fader is driven by the
automation, and not by the user. The Gain fader will turn grey to show
it is inactive.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="vcas">VCAs</p>
<p>If at least one <a class="reference external" href="#control-masters-mixer-strips">VCA</a> exists, this
button will show up, allowing the user to link this track to any control
master.</p>
<p>Clicking the button lists all the available control masters, and a menu
option to Unassign all. Notice that a track can be a slave to as many
VCAs as they are in the session, hence multiplying the number of VCA
buttons. The displayed number is the number of the VCA, not the count of
VCAs linked to the track. A track with no VCA assigned will show a
unique button with a “-vca-” label instead of this number.</p>

<div class="figure" id="id507">

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">A bus mixer strip</span></p>
</div>
<p>An Ardour bus can be considered a virtual track, as in a track that
doesn’t have a playlist (so, no regions). Its use is to “group” some
audio signals to be treated the same way. One simple use case is to
group all the audio tracks containing the different drums of a drum kit.
Routing all the drum tracks’ outputs to a bus allows, once the different
levels amongst the drums have been set, to adjust the global level of
the drum kit in the mix.</p>
<p>Bus usage goes way beyond this simple example though: busses, as tracks,
can receive plugins for common audio treatment, and be routed themselves
as needed. This makes for a very useful tool that is very commonly used
both for musical purposes and computing ones: instead of using e.g. ten
discrete delay plugins on ten different tracks, busses are often used as
receivers of <a class="reference external" href="#aux-sends">sends</a>, and only one delay plugin is used
on this bus, reducing the processing power needed.</p>
<p>Audio Busses vs MIDI Busses
Ardour supports two types of busses: Audio and MIDI. A MIDI bus differs
from an audio bus just by:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>its input (which is midi, as shown by the red signal lines in the
processor box) instead of <em>n</em> audio</li>
<li>the fact that an instrument can be placed on it at creation time,
whereas it can’t easily be done for an audio bus</li>
<li>as for tracks, the MIDI bus doesn’t have a trim knob or invert phase
button(s).</li>
</ul>
<p>MIDI busses provide a particularly efficient workflow for virtual drum
kits where the arrangement uses different MIDI tracks. Moreover, busses
with both Audio and MIDI inputs are well suited for vocoders and similar
plugins, where a MIDI signal controls an audio one.</p>
<p>Adding any audio input to a MIDI bus transforms it into an audio bus.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="description">Description</p>
<p>Busses look and behave exactly like tracks, so they share nearly <a class="reference external" href="#audiomidi-mixer-strips">all of
their controls</a>. The differences are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>as the busses don’t have a playlist (and cannot host any media), they
can’t be recorded on. The recording controls are not present</li>
<li>an Aux button replaces these controls.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clicking the Aux button makes every track that sends a signal to this
bus through <a class="reference external" href="#aux-sends">Aux sends</a> blink in turquoise. Right
clicking this button brings up a menu:</p>

<p>Depending on the user’s workflow and the way busses are used, two
possibilities exists:</p>

<img alt="Connecting a bus through a track's outputs" src="_images/connecting_bus_output.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Connecting a bus through a track’s outputs</span></p>
</div>
<p>Connecting the output(s) of a track to the input(s) of the bus sends
<em>all</em> the audio/MIDI to the bus. In the mixer strip, select (at the
bottom) the OUTPUT button (often, by default, “Master”), and in the
list, choose the input of a bus. Note that only the bus able to receive
this output will show up, e.g. a mono bus won’t be able to be connected
to the output of a stereo track).</p>
<p>Obviously, doing so will (by default) disconnect the output from the
Master’s input, which means all the audio/MIDI will be routed to the
bus. For more complex routing, the OUTPUT button allows to show the
Routing Grid that allows to plug the output of the track to multiple
outputs at once, be it busses, tracks, Master… The button will then
reflect these multiple connections by showing a <em>*number*</em>, number
being the number of connections made in the routing grid.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="connecting-a-track-to-a-bus-via-sends">Connecting a track to a bus via Sends</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Connecting a bus through a send</span></p>
</div>
<p>This allows not to interrupt the natural flow of the signal, i.e. the
track will still output to what its connected to (e.g. Master). The
signal is “tapped” at the point of insertion of the send, to be sent to
the bus, by right clicking where in the signal flow the signal should be
tapped, and selecting New Aux Send… &gt; name_of_the_bus.</p>
<p>By left-clicking the send meter, it is possible to adjust the amount of
signal sent to the bus. This is often the way tracks are connected to an
effect bus, like a Delay bus.</p>
<p>Busses can be plugged to other busses, through outputs or sends. Both
example workflows discussed previously, i.e. busses for grouping tracks
and busses for effects, can both coexist, as e.g. a “grouping” drum bus
can have a send to a reverb bus, and be connected to a compressor bus.</p>

<p>Although track/bus <a class="reference external" href="#the-track-and-bus-group-list">groups</a> offer a
certain kind of grouped-control over gain, solo, mute and more,
traditional mixing consoles have long had group master channels (“VCAs”)
which allows to combine both a single fader to control the group level
while also allowing to easily adjust the relative levels inside the
group. For large projects, this can make mixing much easier to control.</p>
<p>Ardour implements those VCAs in a way that allows to use either or both
of the conventions used on different traditional consoles for combining
multiple masters:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Nest VCAs (VCA 2 controls VCA 1 etc.)</li>
<li>Chain VCAs (VCA 1 and VCA 2 both control track or bus <em>N</em>)</li>

exists, i.e., a VCA must be created <em>before</em> connecting tracks to it.</p>
<p>Clicking the VCA button shows all the VCAs in the session, and any or
all of this VCA can be checked to link them to the track, making this
track controlled by multiple VCAs. The track will then show multiple

<p>The Monitor section is an optional feature that provides Control
Room/Monitor Speaker outputs. It can be activated for the current
session in the <a class="reference external" href="#monitoring-tab">Session &gt; Properties window</a> by
enabling the Use monitor section in this session option in the
Monitoring tab. By default the Monitor Section is fed with audio from
the Master Bus, but depending on solo mode and other functions such as
Auditioning, other audio sources may be temporarily heard instead.</p>
<p>The Monitor section appears on the right hand side of the Mixer, and
comprises:</p>

<p class="clear rubric" id="id9">31 - Sessions</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="whats-in-a-session">31.1 - What’s in a Session?</p>
<p>The Session is the fundamental document type that is created and
modified by the Ardour workstation. A Session is a folder on a computer
filesystem that contains all the items that pertain to a particular
project or “recording/editing/mixing session”.</p>
<p>The Session folder includes these files and folders:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">session_name.ardour</span></code> the main session snapshot</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*.ardour</span></code>, any additional snapshots</li>

Clean-up &gt; Clean-up Unused Sources operation, will be purged by Flush
Waste Basket, see <a class="reference external" href="#cleaning-up-sessions">Cleaning Up Sessions</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>A session combines some setup information (such as audio and MIDI
routing, musical tempo &amp; meter, timecode synchronization, etc.) with one
or more Tracks and Buses, and all the Regions and Plug-Ins they contain.</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="where-are-sessions-stored">31.2 - Where Are Sessions Stored?</p>
<p>Sessions are stored in a single folder on the computer’s filesystem. The
first time Ardour is run, it will ask for the default location for this
folder, with the initial choice being the current user’s home folder.</p>
<p>After the first-run dialog, the default location can still be changed at
any time via Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Misc &gt; Session Management. A
particular (different) location for a session can also be specified when
creating it, in the <a class="reference external" href="#newopen-session-dialog">New Session dialog</a>.</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="newopen-session-dialog">31.3 - New/Open Session Dialog</p>
<p>The initial Session dialog, displayed at each start of Ardour, consists

by clicking on the arrow next to the session name to display all
snapshots, and then selecting one.</p>
<p>If the session is not displayed in the Recent Sessions list, the Other

<p>Alternatively, a New Session can be created.</p>

</div>
<p>This page allows to type in the name of a session, select a folder to
save it in, and optionally use an existing
<a class="reference external" href="#session-templates">template</a>.</p>
<p>The different templates, both the “factory” ones and the ones created by
the user, are easily available on the left-side panel. Depending on the
chosen template, a specific Template Settings window may be shown,
allowing the user to fine-tune the details of the template and/or choose
between the different options of the template.</p>
<p>Templates can be huge time savers when working on similar projects, or
on usual projects, as they allow to preset and tweak a lot of the
<a class="reference external" href="#session-properties-dialog">session properties</a>, (like the
availability of a <a class="reference external" href="#monitor-section">monitoring section</a>, connection
to a Master Bus, etc.), and handle the creation of
<a class="reference external" href="#adding-tracks-busses-and-vcas">tracks</a> of any kind.</p>
<p>The Empty Template preset allows to create a session “from scratch”.
Everything a session template does can be done manually —albeit more
tediously— and the resulting sessions will not differ whatsoever.</p>
<p>As of Ardour 5.12, which introduced the new template dialog, the factory
templates are:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">

<p>This operation does <strong>not</strong> make a new session folder—the existing

saved before a rename operation, it will be saved automatically and then
renaming will continue.</p>
<p>Ardour’s Session &gt; Save As operation will not make a new copy of the

<p>Sessions can have various items of metadata attached to them, and saved
in the session file. These metadata are filled by the user via Session &gt;
Metadata &gt; Edit Metadata….</p>
<p>These metadata will be exported as tags in the audio and video files

Ogg-Vorbis (tagged) and FLAC (tagged) audio format will be exported with
the metadata (as Vorbis comment).</p>
<p>Ardour can also reuse the metadata from another session file in the
current session, with Session &gt; Metadata &gt; Import Metadata…. This menu
brings up a file selector, asking for the source ardour session file to
extract the data from. This can be handy when reusing a lot of
information (Author, Artist Name, etc…) or working on multiple tracks of
the same media.</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="backup-and-sharing-of-sessions">31.6 - Backup and Sharing of Sessions</p>
<p>An Ardour session is stored in a single folder on the computer’s
filesystem. This makes backup very easy: any tool capable of backing up
a folder can be used to backup a session. The location of a session is
picked when it is created —by default it will be in the default session
location, which can be altered via Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; General &gt;
Session.</p>
<p>The single folder approach also makes sharing a project easy. Simply
copy the session folder (onto a storage device, or across a network) and
another Ardour user (on any platform) will be able to use it.</p>
<p>There is one complication in both cases: a session may reference media
files that are stored outside of the session folder, if the user has
opted not to select Session &gt; Import &gt; Copy to Session during import.
Backing up a session with embedded files will not create a copy of the
session containing those files. To bring those external files to the
session folder, the <a class="reference external" href="#cleaning-up-sessions">Session &gt; Clean-up &gt; Bring all media into session

<p>The Audio Compression selection accepts any of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>None</li>
<li>FLAC 16bit</li>
<li>FLAC 24bit</li>
</ul>
<p>Encoding the audio sources to FLAC allows for a good size reduction of
the session. It should be noted though that FLAC is a fixed-point
format, meaning that if the audio in the session is in a floating-point
format, this conversion will lose some information on the samples values
that are rounded, though usually, this lost information cannot be
perceived. Choosing “<em>None</em>” for Audio Compression does not compress the
audio to FLAC, hence preserving the floating-point data at the cost of a
bigger file size. Notice also that converting to FLAC automatically
normalizes the audio.</p>
<p>Using the Exclude unused audio sources option allows to only keep the
files actually used in the session, which can be useful to leave any
unused take or reference material out of the backup, reducing the
archive’s global file size.</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="id10">32 - Tracks</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="track-types">32.1 - Track Types</p>
<p>Ardour offers three track types depending on the type of data they
contain, and differentiates between three track modes, depending on
their recording behaviour.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="track-types-1">Track types</p>
<p>An Ardour track can be of type audio or MIDI, depending on the data that
the track will primarily record and play back. <em>However, either type of
track can pass either type of data.</em> Hence, for example, one might have
a MIDI track that contains an instrument plugin; such a track would
record and play back MIDI data from disk but would produce audio, since
the instrument plugin would turn MIDI data into audio data.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when adding tracks to a session, its content is typically
known, and Ardour offers three choices:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Audio</td>

to use when planning to work with
existing or newly recorded audio.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>MIDI</td>
<td>A MIDI track is created with a
single MIDI input, and a single
MIDI output. This is the type of
track to use when planning to

are several methods to enable
playback of a MIDI track: add an
instrument plugin to the track,
connect the track to a software
synthesizer, or connect it to
external MIDI hardware.
If an instrument plugin is added,
the MIDI track outputs audio
alongside MIDI data.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Audio/MIDI</td>
<td>There are a few notable plugins

Audio and MIDI data (Reaktor is
one, and various “auto-tune” like
plugins are another). It can be

</div>
<p>The screenshot on the right shows the subtle difference between an
overdub in normal mode (upper track) and one in non-layered mode (lower
track). Both tracks were created using identical audio data.</p>
<p>The upper track shows a new region which has been layered on top of the
the existing (longer) region. It can be seen by the region name strips.</p>
<p>The lower track has split the existing region in two, trimmed each new
region to create space for the new overdub, and inserted the overdub
region in between.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="channelconfiguration">Channel Configuration</p>
<p>Ardour tracks can have any number of inputs and any number of outputs,
and the number of either can be changed at any time (subject to
restrictions caused by any plugins in a track). However it is useful to
not have to configure this sort of thing for the most common cases, and
so the <a class="reference external" href="#adding-tracks-busses-and-vcas">Add Tracks</a> dialog allows to
select “Mono”, “Stereo” and few other typical multichannel presets</p>
<p>The name of the preset describes the number of input channels of the
track or bus.</p>
<p>If Ardour is configured to automatically connect new tracks and busses,
the number of outputs will be determined by the number of inputs of the
master <a class="reference external" href="#understanding-basic-concepts-and-terminology">bus</a>, to which
the track outputs will be connected.</p>
<p>For example, with a two-channel master bus, a Mono track has one input
and two outputs; a Stereo track has two inputs and two outputs.</p>
<p>If Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Signal Flow &gt; Track and Bus Connections is set
to manual, then tracks will be left disconnected by default and there
will be as many outputs as there are inputs. It is up to the user to
connect them as desired. This is not a particularly useful way to work
unless something fairly unusual is done with signal routing and
processing. It is almost always preferable to leave Ardour make
connections automatically, even if some changes are manually done later.</p>

<p>Ardour does not impose any particular ordering of tracks and busses in
either the editor or mixer windows. The default arrangements are as
follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In the Editor window, the Master bus will always be on top unless
hidden. Tracks and busses will appear in their initial order, from
top to bottom. The monitor section (if used) is never visible in the
editor window.</li>
<li>In the Mixer window, the tracks and busses will be displayed in their
initial order, from left to right. The Master bus is always on the
far right and occupies its own pane, so that it is always visible no
matter how many other mixer strips are present. If a Monitor section

also be torn off into a separate window.</li>
</ul>
<p class="rubric" id="reordering-tracks">Reordering Tracks</p>

<p class="clear rubric" id="controlling-track-appearance">33 - Controlling Track Appearance</p>
<p>Ardour offers many options for controlling the appearance of tracks,
including color, height, waveform style and more. These can all be found
in the Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Editor menu.</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="layering-display">33.1 - Layering Display</p>
<div class="figure" id="id529">
<img alt="The Track layering menu" src="_images/track-layer-dialog.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The Track layering menu</span></p>
</div>
<p>Ardour allows arbitrary layering of regions—there can any number of
regions at a given position. By default, the regions are overlaid in the
editor window, to save vertical space.</p>
<p>However, this display mode can be confusing for tracks with many
overdubs, because its not obvious in which order the overdubs are
layered. Although there are other methods of moving particular regions
to the top of an overlapping set, and although Ardour also has playlists
to manage <a class="reference external" href="#playlist-usecases">takes</a> a bit more efficiently than
just continually layering, there are times when being able to clearly
see all regions in a track without any overlaps is reassuring and
useful.</p>
<p>The example below shows a track with a rather drastic overdub situation,
viewed in normal overlaid mode:</p>
<div class="figure" id="id530">
<img alt="Overlapping regions in *overlaid* mode" src="_images/overlaps_layered.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Overlapping regions in <em>overlaid</em> mode</span></p>
</div>
<p>This display can be changed by right clicking on the track header,
showing the menu displayed above. There are two choices for layers, and
overlaid is currently selected. Clicking on stacked, the track display
changes to:
.. figure:: /images/layers_stacked.png</p>
<blockquote>
<div><table class="docutils field-list" frame="void" rules="none">
<col class="field-name" />
<col class="field-body" />
<tbody valign="top">

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Overlapping regions in <em>stacked</em> mode</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Regions can still be moved around as usual, and can be dragged so that
they overlay each other again, but when the mouse button is released,
things will flip back to them all being stacked cleanly. The number of
lanes for the track is determined by the maximum number of regions
existing in any one spot throughout the track, so if a track has 10
overdubs stacked up in one spot, it will end up with 10 lanes.
Obviously, using a large track height works much better for this than a
small one.</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="track-color">33.2 - Track Color</p>
<p>New tracks in Ardour are assigned a random color from a pastel color
palette, so they should never end up being particularly bright or
particularly dark.</p>

<p>Changing the color of a track is done by selecting the track(s) and
right clicking on the track header of one of them then from the context
menu, selecting Color and picking a hue in the color dialog. Every
selected track will be re-colored.</p>
<p>If only one track is changed, right clicking on that track’s header will
be enough to select it, saving the extra mouse click.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="changing-the-color-of-all-tracks-in-a-group">Changing the color of all tracks in a group</p>
<p>Tracks that belong to a <a class="reference external" href="#the-track-and-bus-group-list">track/bus

the group tab in the Mixer, selecting Edit Group… and then clicking on
the Color selector in the displayed dialog.</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="track-height">33.3 - Track Height</p>
<p>At some stage of the production, a quick overview over as many tracks as
possible may be required, or a detailed view into just a few, or a

individually for each track in the editor window, or globally.</p>

<p>A right click on a track header will display the Height menu, and allow
to choose from a list of standard sizes. All selected tracks will be
redrawn using that height.</p>
<p>Alternatively, moving the pointer to the bottom edge of a track header
will change the cursor to a two-way vertical arrow shape. Left-dragging
dynamically resizes all selected tracks.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="resizing-all-the-tracks">Resizing all the tracks</p>
<p>The three rightmost items of the <a class="reference external" href="#zoom-controls">Zoom Controls</a>, in

heights and view so that the selected tracks completely fill the
vertical space available, unless the tracks cannot be fitted even at the
smallest possible size.</p>

operation.</p>
<p class="clear rubric" id="waveform-display">33.4 - Waveform display</p>
<p>The display of waveforms (or, more correctly, peak envelopes, since the
actual waveform is only visible at the highest zoom levels) is

support different use cases and user preferences. The following options

at higher zoom levels, the individual samples.</p>
<p>Logarithmic</p>
<p>Alternatively, a logarithmic display of the peak envelope can be used.
This will give a better idea of program loudness (it is similar to dBs)
and plot soft passages more clearly, which is useful for soft recordings
or small track height.</p>

<h2>34.3 - Adding Pre-existing Material<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-pre-existing-material" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are several ways to importing an audio or MIDI file into a

<ul class="simple">
<li>Session &gt; Import</li>
<li>Region List context menu: Import To Region List</li>
<li>Track context menu: Import Existing Media</li>
</ul>
<p>These methods are all equivalent: they open the <a class="reference external" href="#import-dialog">Add Existing

<p>Finally, files can also easily be imported into a project by dragging
and dropping a file from some other application (e.g. the system’s file
manager). Files can either be dragged onto the Region List, into the
desired track or into an empty space in the editor track display.</p>
<p>The file will be imported and copied into the session, and placed at the

<div class="section" id="copying-versus-linking">
<h2>34.4 - Copying Versus Linking<a class="headerlink" href="#copying-versus-linking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Copying and linking are two different methods of using existing audio
files on the computer (or network file system) within a session. They
differ in one key aspect:</p>
<div class="section" id="copying">
<h3>Copying<a class="headerlink" href="#copying" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An existing media file is copied to the session’s audio folder, and if
necessary converted into the session’s native format.</p>
<p>For audio files, the format can be chosen (e.g. WAVE or Broadcast WAVE).
Audio files will also be converted to the session sample rate if
necessary (which can take several minutes for larger files).</p>
<p>MIDI files will already be in SMF format, and are simply copied into the
session’s MIDI folder.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="linking">
<h3>Linking<a class="headerlink" href="#linking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A link to an existing media file somewhere on the disk is used as the
source for a region, but the data is <strong>not copied or modified</strong> in any
way.</p>
<p>While linking is handy to conserve disk space, it means that the session
is no longer self-contained. If the external file moves, it will become
unavailable, and any changes to it from elsewhere will affect the
session. A backup of the session directory will miss linked files.</p>
<p>The Copy file to session option in the Import dialog window allows to
choose to copy or link files into the session:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />

<h2>34.5 - Searching for Files Using Tags<a class="headerlink" href="#searching-for-files-using-tags" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A tag is bit of information, or metadata, that is associated with a data
file. Specifically, tags are texts, keywords or terms that have some
relevance to a particular sound file. Ardour can store these tags in a
searchable database so that they can quickly be searched for to retrieve
sounds based on the tags that have been assigned to them.</p>
<p>For example if the term 120bpm has been assigned to a sound, search
later for this tag will make the file appear in the search list. Tags
are independent of the filename or anything else about the file. Tags,
and the file paths that they are associated with, are stored in a file
called sfdb in the Ardour user folder.</p>
<div class="section" id="creating-and-adding-tags">
<h3>Creating and adding tags<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-and-adding-tags" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Adding tags to a given file is done by opening the Session &gt; Import

tag area in the soundfile information box on the right.</p>
<p>Tags are stored when the input box loses focus, there is no need to
explicitly save them.</p>
<p>To have more than one tag for a file, new tags can either be added on
new lines (meaning the Enter key is pressed between two tags) or they
can be separated from the previous ones by a comma (,), with or without
spaces.</p>

<h2>35.2 - Snapshots<a class="headerlink" href="#snapshots" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A snapshot is a backup of the current state of a session. It differs
from a simple save by allowing branching. It is a “frozen” version of
the session at a certain point in time.</p>
<p>For example, creating a snapshot before changing the entire arrangement
of a piece, or drastically altering the signal processing provides a
reference to come back to, should that not work out.</p>
<p>This is accomplished by using either of the Session &gt; Snapshot menus. A
small dialog will appear, allowing to enter a name for the snapshot. The

<p>Any number of snapshots can be created.</p>
<p>Creating a snapshot does <strong>not</strong> modify the session, nor does it save

<h2>35.3 - Cleaning Up Sessions<a class="headerlink" href="#cleaning-up-sessions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Recording and editing any serious session might leave the session with

this clutter thanks to the tools located in the Session &gt; Clean-up menu.</p>
<div class="section" id="bring-all-media-into-session-folder">
<span id="id11"></span><h3>Bring all media into session folder<a class="headerlink" href="#bring-all-media-into-session-folder" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When <a class="reference external" href="#adding-pre-existing-material">importing media files</a>, if the
Copy files to session has not been checked, Ardour uses the source file
from its original destination, which can help avoiding file duplication.
Nevertheless, when the session needs to be archived or transferred to
another computer, moving the session folder will not move those
<em>external</em> files as they are not in the folder, as seen in <a class="reference external" href="#backup-and-sharing-of-sessions">Backup and

<div class="section" id="reset-peak-files">
<span id="id12"></span><h3>Reset Peak Files<a class="headerlink" href="#reset-peak-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Ardour represents audio waveforms with peak files, that are graphical
images generated from the sound files. This generation can be time and
CPU consuming, so it uses a cache of the generated images to speed up
the display process. To watch for files modification, Ardour relies on
the file-modification time. If an external file is embedded in the
session and that file changes, but the system-clock is skewed or it is
stored on an external USB disk (VFAT), Ardour can’t know the change
happened, and will still use its deprecated peak files.</p>
<p>Using the Reset Peak Files menu allows to reset this cache, which frees
up disk space, and forces the re-creation of the peak files used in the
session. It can prove useful if some waveforms are not used anymore, or
if a graphical or time glitch happens.</p>

<span id="id13"></span><h3>Clean-up Unused Sources…<a class="headerlink" href="#clean-up-unused-sources" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Recording usually leaves a lot of unused takes behind, be it in midi or
audio form, that can clutter the Region List, and eat up a lot of hard
drive space. While its generally a good practice to keep as many things
as possible while recording, when transferring or archiving the session,
some clean up can help a lot in reducing the sessions clutter and size.</p>
<p>Selecting Clean-up Unused Sources… will force Ardour to detect those
unused waveforms by looking for unused regions, and (through a prompt)
for unused playlists. The media files will not be destroyed, though. At
this stage, they are just copied in a particular place of the session
path (namely, in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dead</span> <span class="pre">sounds/</span></code> sub-folder).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="flush-wastebasket">
<span id="id14"></span><h3>Flush Wastebasket<a class="headerlink" href="#flush-wastebasket" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Although Ardour is a <em>non-destructive</em> audio-editor, it allows for a
very careful destruction of unused media materials. This function is
closely linked to the previous one. When the unused sources have been
cleaned up and quarantined, the Flush Wastebasket menu will allow for
their physical destruction.</p>
<p>As a safeguarding mechanism though, Flushing the wastebasket in
impossible in the same working session as the Cleaning up of unused
sources: the user needs to close the session and reload it before
flushing. It allows to test the playback of the session and ensure both
that Ardour did not commit any mistake (unlikely, but better safe than
sorry), and that the user is absolutely sure of what he does.</p>
<p>All media destroyed this way is not sent to the system’s <em>trash can</em> but
permanently deleted. If a file is mistakenly destroyed this way, the
user will have to rely on data recovery techniques to try getting it
back.</p>

<h2>37.1 - Monitoring<a class="headerlink" href="#monitoring" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When recording, it is important that performers hear themselves, and any
pre-recorded tracks they are performing with.</p>
<p>Audio recorders typically allow monitoring (i.e. listening to) the input
signal of all tracks that are armed for recording, and playing back the
unarmed tracks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="latency-considerations">
<h2>37.2 - Latency Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#latency-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the days of analog tape recording, the routing of monitor signals was
performed with relays and other analog audio switching devices. Digital
recorders have the same feature, but may impart some
<a class="reference external" href="#latency-and-latency-compensation">latency</a> (delay) between the time
a noise is made and the time that it will come back from the recorder.</p>
<p>The latency of <em>any</em> conversion from analog to digital and back to
analog is about 1.5–2&nbsp;ms. Some musicians claim that even the basic A/D/A
conversion time is objectionable. However even acoustic instruments such
as the piano can have approximately 3&nbsp;ms of latency, due to the time the
sound takes to travel from the instrument to the musician’s ears.
Latency below 5&nbsp;ms should be suitable for a professional recording
setup. Because 2&nbsp;ms are already used in the A/D/A process, extremely low
buffer sizes must be used in the workstation I/O setup to keep the
overall latency below 5ms. Not all <a class="reference external" href="#the-right-computer-system-for-digital-audio">computer audio
systems</a> are able to
work reliably at such low buffer sizes.</p>
<p>For this reason it is sometimes best to route the monitor signal through
an external mixing console while recording, an approach taken by most if
not all professional recording studios. Many computer I/O devices have a
hardware mixer built in which can route the monitor signal “around” the
computer, avoiding the system latency.</p>
<p>In either case, the monitoring hardware may be digital or analog. And in
the digital case there will still be the A-D-A conversion latency of
1–2&nbsp;ms.</p>

<div class="section" id="monitor-signal-flow">
<h2>37.3 - Monitor Signal Flow<a class="headerlink" href="#monitor-signal-flow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">External monitoring</span></p>
</div>
<p>When using external monitoring, Ardour plays no role in monitoring at
all. Perhaps the recording set-up has an external mixer which can be
used to set up monitor mixes, or perhaps the sound-card being used has a
“listen to the input” feature. This approach yields zero or near-zero
latency. On the other hand it requires external hardware, and the
monitoring settings are less flexible and not saved with the session.</p>

<p>Some sound cards have the ability to mix signals from their inputs to
their outputs with very low or even zero latency, a feature called
hardware monitoring. Furthermore, on some cards this function can be
controlled by JACK. This is a nice arrangement, if the sound card
supports it, as it combines the convenience of having the monitoring
controlled by Ardour with the low latency operation of doing it
externally.</p>

<p>With the software monitoring approach, all monitoring is performed by
Ardour—it makes track inputs available at track outputs, governed by
various controls. This approach will almost always have more routing
flexibility than JACK-based monitoring. The disadvantage is that there
will be some latency between the input and the output, which depends for
the most part on the JACK buffer size that is being used.</p>

<p>It is very useful to be able to tag different locations in a session for

define specific positions in time, and ranges which define a start and
end position in time.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard location markers, there are three kinds of
special markers:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>CD markers are locations that are restricted to legal CD sector
boundaries. They can be used to add track index markers to compact
disc images.</li>
<li>The Loop range defines the start and end points for Looping.</li>

<div class="section" id="working-with-regions-1">
<span id="id21"></span><h3>Working With Regions<a class="headerlink" href="#working-with-regions-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Regions are the basic elements of editing and composing in Ardour. In
most cases, a region represents a single contiguous section of one or
more media files. Regions are defined by a fixed set of attributes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the audio or MIDI source file(s) they represent,</li>
<li>an offset (the “start point”) in the audio or MIDI file(s), and</li>
<li>a length.</li>
</ul>
<p>When placed into a playlist, they gain additional attributes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a position along the timeline, and</li>
<li>a layer.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other attributes as well, but they do not <em>define</em> the region.
Things to know about regions:</p>
<div class="section" id="regions-are-cheap">
<h4>Regions Are Cheap<a class="headerlink" href="#regions-are-cheap" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>By themselves, regions consume very little in terms of computer’s
resources. Each region requires a small amount of memory, and represents
a rather small amount of CPU work if placed into an active track. So,
multiplying regions creation whenever needed should not be much of an
issue CPU wise.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="regions-are-not-files">
<h4>Regions Are Not Files<a class="headerlink" href="#regions-are-not-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Although a region can represent an entire audio file, they are never
equivalent to an audio file. Most regions represent just parts of an
audio file(s) on disk, and removing a region from a track has nothing to
do with removing the audio file(s) from the disk (the Destroy operation,
one of Ardour’s few destructive operations, can affect this). Changing
the length of a region has no effect on the audio file(s) on disk.
Splitting and copying regions does not alter the audio file in any way,
nor does it create new audio files (only recording, and the Export,
Bounce and Reverse operations create new audio files).</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="region-naming">
<h2>40.2 - Region Naming<a class="headerlink" href="#region-naming" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Region names are initially derived from either:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the name of the track for which they were recorded, or</li>
<li>the name of the embedded/imported file they represent.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="whole-file-region-names">
<h3>Whole File Region Names<a class="headerlink" href="#whole-file-region-names" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>These are not audio files, but regions that represent the full extent of
an audio file. Every time a new recording is done, or a new file is
imported to the session, a new region is created that represents the
entire audio file. This region will have the name of the
track/playlist/original file, followed by a “-“, then a number plus a
dot and then a number.</p>
<p>For recorded regions, the number will increase each time a new recording
is made. So, for example, if there is a track called Didgeridoo, the
first recorded whole file region for that playlist will be called
Didgeridoo-1. The next one will be Didgeridoo-2 and so on.</p>
<p>For imported regions, the region name will be based on the original file
name, but with any final suffix (e.g. “.wav” or “.aiff”) removed.</p>
<p>Normally, whole file regions are not inserted into tracks or playlists,
but regions derived from them are. The whole-file versions live in the
<a class="reference external" href="#the-region-list">Editor’s region list</a> where they act as an
organizing mechanism for regions that are derived from them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="normal-region-names">
<h3>Normal Region Names<a class="headerlink" href="#normal-region-names" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When a region is inserted into a track and playlist, its initial name
will end in a version number, such as .1. For a recorded region, if the
whole file region was Hang drum-1, then the region in the track will
appear with the name Hang drum-1.1. For an imported region, if the whole
file region was Bach:Invention3, then the region in the track will
appear with the name Bach:Invention3.1.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="copied-region-names">
<h3>Copied Region Names<a class="headerlink" href="#copied-region-names" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Duplicating or splitting a region creates new region(s) that are based
on the same original files. Hence, they share the same base name (in the
example above, Hang drum-1), but their version number will be
incremented each time. Duplicating Hang drum-1.4 by left dragging it
will create a new region called Hang drum-1.5. Splitting Hang drum-1.5
by hitting the S key will remove the Hang drum-1.5 region and create two
shorter regions named Hang drum-1.6 and Hang drum-1.7.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="renaming-regions">
<h3>Renaming Regions<a class="headerlink" href="#renaming-regions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Regions can be renamed at any time using the region context menu : right
click &gt; <em>name_of_the_region</em> &gt; Rename… . The new name does not need to
have a version number in it (in fact, it probably should not). Ardour
will add a version number in the future if needed (e.g. if the region is
copied or sliced).</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="#the-track-and-bus-group-list">Track Groups</a> have a property titled
Select which, if enabled, cause Ardour to propagate a region selection
in one track of a group to the corresponding regions of the other tracks
in that group.</p>
<p>This can be particularly useful when an instrument has been recorded
using multiple microphones (e.g. a drum kit): by enabling the Select
property for the group, selecting a region in one of the tracks, Ardour
will select the corresponding region in every other track of the group,
which in turn means that a subsequent edit operation will affect all the
tracks together.</p>

<h3>How Ardour Decides Which Regions are “Corresponding”<a class="headerlink" href="#how-ardour-decides-which-regions-are-corresponding" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Regions in different tracks are considered to be corresponding for the
purposes of sharing selection if they satisfy <em>all</em> the following
criteria:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>each region starts at the same offset within its source file,</li>
<li>each region is located at the same position on the timeline, and</li>
<li>each region has the same length.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="overlap-correspondence">
<h3>Overlap Correspondence<a class="headerlink" href="#overlap-correspondence" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes, the rules outlined above are too strict to get Ardour to
consider regions as corresponding. Regions may have been trimmed to
slightly different lengths, or positioned slightly differently, and this
will cause Ardour to not select regions in other grouped tracks.</p>
<p>In this case, changing Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Editor &gt; Regions in active
edit groups are edited together: to whenever they overlap in time will
allow regions in different tracks to be considered equivalent for the
purposes of selection if they overlap. This is much more flexible and
will cover almost all of the cases that the fixed rules above might make
cumbersome.</p>

<p>New values for the clock can be typed in after clicking on the relevant

to the right of the next character to be overwritten. Time should be
typed in the same order as the current clock mode—if the clock is in
Timecode mode, it should be hours, minutes, seconds, frames. So, to
change to a time of 12:15:20:15 one would type 12152015. Each number
typed will appear in a different color, from right to left, overwriting
the existing value. Mid-edit, after typing 3222 the clock might look

<p>Finishing the edit is done by pressing ↵ or Tab. The ESC key allows to
exit an edit without changing the clock. If an entry is mis-typed so
that the new value would be illegal (for example, resulting in more than

reset at the end of the edit, and move the cursor back to the start to

without the mouse. It can be found in Window &gt; Key Bindings &gt; Transport

<p>One detail of the editing design that is not immediately obvious is that
it is possible to enter part of a full time value.</p>
<p>As an example, supposing that the clock is in BBT mode, displaying
024|03|0029, altering the value to the first beat of the current bar can
be done by clicking on the clock and typing 010000. Similarly, if it is
in Minutes:Seconds mode, displaying 02:03:04.456, getting to exactly 2

<p>Values can also be typed into the clock that are intended as a relative
change, rather than a new absolute value, by ending the edit by pressing
+ or - (the ones on any keypad will also work). The plus key will add
the entered value to the current value of the clock, minus will subtract
it. For example, if the clock is in Samples mode and displays 2917839,

<h2>41.2 - Which Regions Are Affected?<a class="headerlink" href="#which-regions-are-affected" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section explains the rules used to decide which regions are
affected by editing operations. They don’t really have to be
understood—hopefully things will Just Work—but it may be useful
eventually.</p>
<p>Editing operations in Ardour either operate on a single point in time
(Split being the obvious example) or on two points (which can also be
considered to be a range of sorts), Separate is a good example of this.</p>
<p>Most operations will operate on the currently selected region(s), but if
no regions are selected, the region that the mouse is in will be used
instead. Single-point operations will generally pick a set of regions to
use based on the following rules:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If the <a class="reference external" href="#edit-point-control">Edit Point</a> is mouse, then<ul>
<li>if the mouse is over a selected region, or no region, use all
selected regions, or</li>
<li>if the mouse is over an unselected region, use just that region.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For all other Edit Points<ul>
<li>use the selected regions <em>and</em> those that are both under the edit
position <em>and</em> on a selected track, or on a track which is in the
same active edit-enabled route group as a selected region.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The rationale here for the two different rules is that the mouse Edit
Point is special in that its position indicates both a time and a track;
the other edit points (Playhead,Marker) indicate a time only.</p>

<h2>43.2 - Push/Pull Trimming<a class="headerlink" href="#push-pull-trimming" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Normally, when trimming regions by dragging with the mouse, it affects
only the selected regions. Their lengths are directly affected by the
trim operation, but nothing else is. Sometimes though, when trimming a
region that directly adjoins another, the desired result is to move the
boundary between the regions and not to make these regions overlap. This
requires trimming both regions on either side of the junction, in
opposite directions. Push/Pull trim, activated by pressing key before
starting the drag, will do just that.</p>
<p>The following pictures show the difference in the results of a normal
trim and a push/pull trim:</p>
<p>In the initial situation, before trimming, two adjacent regions are
present, the rightmost-one being selected.</p>
<p>The simple trim, obtained by dragging the selected region’s starting
position earlier, overlaps the earlier region. A crossfade has been
manually created between them, so their sound will fade from the
leftmost region to the rightmost one.</p>
<p>If the same trim is done, but by Left-dragging to turn it into a
push-pull trim instead, there is no overlap, and the end of the earlier
region has been moved along with the start of the later region, so that
they still directly adjoin each other. In effect, it is like doing a
simple trim to reduce the leftmost region, then doing a simple trim to
extend the rightmost one to fill the gap.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="stretching">
<h2>43.3 - Stretching<a class="headerlink" href="#stretching" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Stretch Mode tool can be switched to by selecting it in the
<a class="reference external" href="#toolbox">Toolbox</a>, or simply by hitting the T key.</p>
<p>It allows to extend or reduce the duration of a region, optionally
maintaining its pitch. This is one of the few operations in Ardour that
affect the underlying audio data from a region, even if the original
audio is kept safely—no data is lost in the process.</p>
<p>This operation is usually used to fit an audio sequence with a different
rhythm into a session, but can be used in a wide area of cases, due to
its ability to maintain or alter the pitch.</p>
<p>The Stretch Mode tool is very similar in use to doing a trim in grab
mode: the boundary (start or end) is left-clicked and dragged to its
wanted position. Notice a timer appearing, showing the new duration of
the region using the same <a class="reference external" href="#editing-clocks">clock mode</a> as in the
<a class="reference external" href="#transport-clocks">primary transport clock</a>.</p>
<p>Stretching is a complex operation (phase vocoding), involving
resampling, frequency analysis and synthesis. The parameters used to
transform the audio data are user tweakable, and exposed to the user as
the left mouse button is released:</p>

choice is <em>Resample without preserving pitch</em></li>
<li>For drum-type material, the best choice is (depending on the

<em>percussion</em> types</li>
<li>For melodic mono-tonal material (bass, winds,…), the best (and

<p>Every Region has a fade-in and fade-out. By default, the region fade is
very short, and serves to de-click the transitions at the start and end
of the region. By adjusting the regions fade length, a more gradual
transition can be accomplished.</p>
<div class="section" id="region-fades">
<h3>Region Fades<a class="headerlink" href="#region-fades" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Region fades are possible at the beginning and end of all audio regions.
In object mode, a grip appears at the top left and top right of an audio
region when the cursor hovers over it. Placing the cursor over the top
of the grip displays the region fade cursor tip. Clicking and dragging
the grip left or right in the timeline adjusts the length of the fade.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="crossfades">
<h3>Crossfades<a class="headerlink" href="#crossfades" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Crossfades refer to the behavior of two audio regions transitioning
smoothly (mixing) from one to another on the same track. Historically,
this was done by splicing two pieces of analog tape together, and this
concept was carried forward into digital editing. Each track is a
sequence of sound files (regions). If two regions are butted against
each other, there needs to be a method to splice them smoothly together.
The crossfade allows one region to fade smoothly out, while the next
region fades smoothly in, like two pieces of tape that have been cut at
an angle, and overlapped.</p>
<p>But Ardour uses a more refined “layered” editing model, and therefore it
is possible for multiple regions to be stacked on a single location with
arbitrary overlaps between different layers. For this reason, crossfades
must be implemented differently. It can’t be assumed that a crossfade is
an entity that exists between two regions; instead each region must have
its own associated crossfades at each end, and the topmost region must
always crossfade down to the underlying region(s), if any.</p>
<p>Ardour solves this problem by putting a crossfade at the beginning and
end of every region. The fades of the bottom-most region are first
rendered, and then each region is rendered on top of the one below it,
with fades at the end of each region providing a crossfade to the
region(s) beneath it.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that region fades <em>are</em> crossfades. When
one region has another region or multiple regions beneath its fade area,
then what will be heard is the topmost region fade-out mirrored as a
fade-in on the underlying region(s). The grip for the topmost region
will allow changing the length and type of the crossfade into the
underlying region(s). In this way complicated series of crossfades can
be created, and then another region layered atop the others, and faded
into a complicated series.</p>
<p>If a region doesn’t have any region(s) under it, then the region is
crossfaded to silence; for convenience this is called a “fade” rather
than a crossfade.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fade-shapes">
<h3>Fade Shapes<a class="headerlink" href="#fade-shapes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The fade shape context menu.</span></p>
</div>
<p>To activate/deactivate or change the shape of a region’s fadein or
fade-out, the cursor has to be hovered over the region fade grip until
the cursor tip indicates region fade editing, then right clicked to
bring up a context menu. In the context menu is a list of options for
the region fade. Activate/Deactivate enables and disables the region
fade.</p>
<p>Because each fade is also a crossfade, it has an inverse fade shape for
the audio beneath the fade. It is important to know how the shapes
differ, and which are most suitable for various editing tasks.</p>
<p>The different types of fades are:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Linear</td>
<td>A simple linear coefficient
decrease, and its mathematical
inverse. A Linear fade starts
attenuating quickly, and then
cuts off even more abruptly at
lower levels. When used as a
crossfade, the signals are each
-6dB attenuated at the midpoint.
This is the correct crossfade to
use with highly-correlated
signals for a smooth transition.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Constant Power</td>
<td>The constant power curve starts
fading slowly and then cuts off
abruptly. When used as a
crossfade between 2 audio
regions, the signals are
symmetrically attenuated, and
they each reach -3dB at the
midpoint. This is the correct
crossfade to use when splicing
audio in the general
(uncorrelated) case.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Symmetric</td>
<td>The Symmetric fade starts slowly,
then attenuates significantly
before transitioning to a slower
fade-out near the end of the
fade. When used as a crossfade,
the Symmetric curve is not
mathematically correct like the
Constant Power or Linear curves,
but it provides a slower fade-out
at low volumes. This is sometimes
useful when editing 2 entire
music works together so that the
transition is more gradual.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Slow</td>
<td>The Slow curve is a modified
linear decibel fade. The initial
curve starts more gradually so
that it has a less abrupt
transition near unity. After
that, it sounds like a perfectly
smooth fader or knob moved to
silence. This shape is excellent
as a general-purpose fade-out.
When used as a crossfade, the
inverse fade curve maintains
constant power but is therefore
non-symmetric; so its use is
limited to those cases where the
user finds it appropriate.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Fast</td>
<td>The Fast curve is a linear
decibel fade; It sounds like a
perfectly smooth fader or knob
moved to silence. This shape is
excellent as a general-purpose
fade-in. When used as a
crossfade, the inverse fade curve
maintains constant power but is
therefore non-symmetric; so its
use is limited to those cases
where the user finds it
appropriate.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Although these fade shapes serve specific purposes, any of the shapes is
usable in any situation, so the final decision is mostly an artistic
choice.</p>
<p>These fade curves are developed to provide a range of common uses, and
are developed with the least possible amount of changes in the “slope”
of the line. This provides artefact-free crossfades. Some DAWs provide
complicated fade editors with parametric “spline” controls of the fade
curves. While it might be interesting to develop a fade curve with a
faster cutoff, the mathematical difference between this and simply
shortening the fade is vanishingly small; and the amount of effort to
shorten the fade is much easier than messing with a crossfade editor
dialog.</p>

<p>In Ardour, every region has a gain envelope, which is normally hidden.
Clicking on the Draw tool will cause all the gain envelopes on all
regions to show themselves; these will appear as green lines with square
dots (control points) at the beginning and end of each region. The
vertical axis represents gain, with the top of the region representing
+6dB and the bottom representing approximately -170dB. By default, the
line starts and ends at 0dB; the control points can be moved up and down
to change the amount of gain at that point.</p>
<p>Gain follows the line between control points continuously during

<h3>Manipulating Gain Envelopes<a class="headerlink" href="#manipulating-gain-envelopes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The default gain curve, by itself, is not very useful; in order to have

extra control points. Clicking anywhere in the region where there are no

<h2>46.1 - Understanding Playlists<a class="headerlink" href="#understanding-playlists" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A playlist is a list of regions ordered in time. It defines which parts
of which source files should be played and when. Playlists are a fairly
advanced topic, and can be safely ignored for many types of audio
production. However, the use of playlists allows the audio engineer more
flexibility for tasks like multiple takes of a single instrument,
alternate edits of a given recording, parallel effects such as reverb or
compression, and other tasks.</p>
<p>Each audio track in Ardour is really just a mechanism for taking a
playlist and generating the audio stream that it represents. As a
result, editing a track really means modifying its playlist in some way.
Since a playlist is a list of regions, most of the modifications involve
manipulating regions: their position, length and so forth. This is
covered in the chapter <a class="reference external" href="#working-with-regions">Working With Regions</a>.</p>
<p>This page covers some of the things that can be done with playlists as
objects in their own right.</p>
<div class="section" id="tracks-are-not-playlists">
<h3>Tracks are not Playlists<a class="headerlink" href="#tracks-are-not-playlists" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is important to understand that a track <em>is not</em> a playlist. A track
<em>has</em> a playlist. A track is a mechanism for generating the audio stream
represented by the playlist and passing it through a signal processing
pathway. At any point in time, a track has a single playlist associated
with it. When the track is used to record, that playlist will have one
or more new regions added to it. When the track is used for playback,
the contents of the playlist will be heard. The playlist associated with
a track can be changed at (almost) any time, and tracks can even share
playlists.</p>
<p>Some other DAWs use the term “virtual track” to define a track that
isn’t actually playing or doing anything, but can be mapped/assigned to
a real track. This concept is functionally identical to Ardour’s
playlists. We just like to be little more clear about what is actually
happening rather than mixing old and new terminology (“virtual” and
“track”), which might be confusing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="playlists-are-cheap">
<h3>Playlists are Cheap<a class="headerlink" href="#playlists-are-cheap" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One thing to bear in mind is that playlists are cheap. They do not cost
anything in terms of CPU consumption, and they have very minimal efforts
on memory use. So generating new playlists whenever needed is
recommended. They are not equivalent to tracks, which require extra CPU
time and significant memory space, or audio files, which use disk space,
or plugins that require extra CPU time. If a playlist is not in use, it
occupies a small amount of memory, and nothing more.</p>

<h3>Renaming Playlists<a class="headerlink" href="#renaming-playlists" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Playlists are created by default with the name of the active playlist,
plus a version number, and the first playlist is named after the track
with which it is associated. So, the first playlist for a track called
“Cowbell” will be called “Cowbell.1”, the next one “Cowbell.2”, etc.
This name can be changed at any time, to anything: Ardour does not
require playlist names to be unique, although it will make the user’s
life easier if they are. Suggested examples of user-assigned names for a
playlist might include Lead Guitar, 2nd take, vocals (quiet), and
downbeat cuica. These might be different from the associated track
names, which for these examples might be Lead Guitar, Vocals and Cuica.
The playlist name provides more information because it is about a
specific version of the material that may (or may not) end up in the
final version of the track.</p>
<p>Using the fact that playlist names are based on the active one with an
incremented version number, one can rename a playlist “Cowbell take.1”
so that the next playlist created is automatically named “Cowbell
take.2” etc. This allows for a quick way to label different takes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sharing-playlists">
<h3>Sharing Playlists<a class="headerlink" href="#sharing-playlists" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is entirely possible to share playlists between tracks. The only
slightly unusual thing that should be noted when sharing is that edits
to the playlist made in one track will magically appear in the other. It
is an obvious consequence of sharing. One application of this attribute
is parallel processing, described in <a class="reference external" href="#playlist-usecases">Playlist Use
Cases</a>.</p>
<p>To avoid this kind of behaviour, and nevertheless use the same (or
substantially the same) playlist on two tracks, the desired playlist
must be chosen in the second track, and then the New Copy… button
clicked. This generates an independent copy of it for that track, which
can then be edited without affecting the original.</p>

<h3>Using Playlists for Parallel Processing<a class="headerlink" href="#using-playlists-for-parallel-processing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One of the uses of playlists is to apply multiple effects to the same
audio stream. For example, applying two different non-linear effects
such as distortion or compression to the same audio source (linear
effects can be just applied one after the other in the same track) can
be done by creating a new track, applying the original track’s playlist,
and then applying effects to both tracks independently.</p>
<p>The same result could be achieved by feeding the track to multiple
busses which then contain the processing, but this increases the overall
latency, complicates routing and uses more space in the Mixer window.</p>

<h3>Using Playlists for “Takes”<a class="headerlink" href="#using-playlists-for-takes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

desired.</p>
<p>Creating a composite edit from multiple takes, can be achieved either:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>by creating a new track to assemble the final version, and “cherry
picking” from the playlists in the original track by copying regions

<p>The Rhythm Ferret is a dedicated tool to speed up the usually labor
intensive task of slicing and adjusting a sound region to match a
specific time grid. It is especially useful for drum tracks, either to
match a different tempo, or to adjust a slightly out of tempo
performance.</p>
<p>It is not limited to this use though, as it supports both percussive and
note type detection, and can be used on melodic material too.</p>
<div class="section" id="accessing-the-rhythm-ferret">
<h3>Accessing the Rhythm Ferret<a class="headerlink" href="#accessing-the-rhythm-ferret" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Rhythm Ferret window can be accessed by right clicking any audio
region, then <em>Name_Of_The_Region</em> &gt; Edit &gt; Rhythm Ferret.</p>
<p>Once the window is open, selecting any region will make it the focus of
the Rhythm Ferret’s detection, hence allowing to process multiple
regions sequentially without reopening the window each time.</p>
<p>The window itself is made of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a “mode” selection</li>
<li>some parameters for this mode</li>
<li>an operation selection, that for now only allows to Split regions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The “Mode” selection<a class="headerlink" href="#the-mode-selection" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As the Rhythm Ferret is able to detect both percussive hits and melodic
notes, it is important to choose the best suited mode for the considered
material, so that Ardour can perform the detection with the greatest
accuracy :</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Percussive Onset will detect the start of each hit based on the
sudden change in energy (= volume) of the waveform</li>
<li>Note Onset will detect the start of each note based on the changes in
the frequency domain.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-percussive-onset-mode">
<h3>The Percussive Onset mode<a class="headerlink" href="#the-percussive-onset-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In this mode, only two parameters are active:</p>

<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Sensitivity (%)</td>
<td>The proportion of the samples
that must exceed the energy rise
threshold in order for an onset

peaks). This roughly corresponds
to how “noisy” a percussive sound
must be in order to be detected.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Cut Pos Threshold (dB)</td>
<td>The rise in energy amongst a

<p>As those parameters are very material-related, there is no recipe for a
perfect match, and a good peak detection is a matter of adjusting those
two parameters by trial and error, and trying using the Analyze button
after each try.</p>

Ardour detects onsets as per the parameters. This markers can be
manually adjusted, see below.</p>

<h3>Manual adjustment<a class="headerlink" href="#manual-adjustment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Using the Rhythm Ferret consists usually in finding the right parameters
to split the audio, by adjusting them and clicking the Analyze button.
Each time an analysis is run, Ardour erases the previous results, and
creates grey markers on the region according to the parameters. Those
markers can be manually dragged with the LEFT mouse button to adjust
their positions.</p>
<p>Once the markers are suitably placed, the second button in the down hand
side of the Rhythm Ferret window allows to Apply the operation. At the
moment of writing, only the Split Region is available, which will split
the region at the markers.</p>
<p>Those regions can then be manually aligned, or have their sync points
set to the closest grid (as per the <a class="reference external" href="#grid-controls">Grid settings</a>

<p>Ardour’s handling of MIDI editing differs from most other DAWs and MIDI
sequencers.</p>
<div class="section" id="key-features-of-ardour-midi-handling">
<h3>Key features of Ardour MIDI handling<a class="headerlink" href="#key-features-of-ardour-midi-handling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All editing is done in-place, in-window. There is no separate piano
roll window or pane. Edit notes right where they appear.</li>
<li>MIDI, just like audio, exists in regions. MIDI regions behave like
audio regions: they can be moved, trimmed, copied (cloned), or
deleted. Ardour allows either editing MIDI (or audio) regions, or
MIDI region content (the notes), but never both at the same time. The
e key (by default) toggles between region level and note level
editing</li>
<li>Editing note information in Ardour occurs in only a single region.
There is no way currently to edit in note data for multiple regions
at the same time, so for example notes cannot be selected in several
regions and then all deleted, nor can they be copied-and-pasted from
one region to another. Region(s), though, can be copy-pasted just as
with audio.</li>
<li>All MIDI I/O is done via JACK for sample accurate timing and maximal
efficiency when communicating with external software synthesizers.</li>
<li>Every MIDI track has its own JACK MIDI port for input; it may have an
arbitrary combination of audio and MIDI outputs, depending on the
signal processing in the track; the full flexibility of JACK
connectivity is present for MIDI just as it is for audio.</li>
<li>Full automation for MIDI tracks, integrated with the handling of all
MIDI CC data for each track.</li>
<li>Controllers (CC data) can be set to discrete or continuous modes (the
latter will interpolate between control points and send additional
data).</li>
<li>There is a Normal and a Percussive mode for note data editing.</li>
<li>The scroomer is a combination scroll/zoom tool for altering the zoom
level and range of visible MIDI data.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="notable-differences">
<h3>Notable Differences<a class="headerlink" href="#notable-differences" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fader (volume) control currently operates on transmitted MIDI data,
not by sending CC #7.</li>
<li>All note/data editing is per-region. There are no cross-region
operations at this time.</li>
<li>By default, copying a MIDI region creates a deep link—both regions
share the same data source, and edits to the contents of one will
affect the other. Breaking this link is done by selecting MIDI &gt;
Unlink from other copies from the region context menu, after which
the selected region(s) will have their own copies of <em>only</em> the data
that they visually display on screen. The region will no longer be
trimmable back to its original length after an Unlink operation, and
the operation cannot be undone.</li>

<p>Although recording MIDI is a common way to create new MIDI regions, it
is often desirable to do so as part of editing/arranging.</p>
<p>Create a new MIDI region is as simple as entering draw mode (press “d”
or click on the pencil tool) and then Left-clicking in a MIDI track. A
region will be created that is one bar long. Alternatively, use the left
button to drag-create a new region of the desired length.</p>

<h3>Adding new notes<a class="headerlink" href="#id28" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In general, most MIDI editing will probably be done with the mouse in
object mode. This allows to select notes, copy, move or delete them and
alter their properties (see below). But at some point, <em>adding</em> notes to
a MIDI region using the mouse will mean dragging with the mouse. Since
this would normally be a selection operation if the mouse is in object
mode, there needs to be some way to tell Ardour that the user is trying
to draw new notes within a MIDI region. Ardour provides two ways do
this. One is to leave the mouse in object mode and Left-drag. The other,
useful to enter a lot of notes for a while, is to switch the mouse into
Draw Notes mode, which will now interpret any drags and clicks as
requests to add a new note. For obvious reasons, Draw Notes mode can not
be used while using region-level editing.</p>

<h2>53 - Handling Overlapping Notes<a class="headerlink" href="#handling-overlapping-notes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Every MIDI note consists of two messages, a NoteOn and a NoteOff. Each
one has a note number and a channel (also a velocity, but that isn’t
relevant here). The MIDI standard stresses that it is invalid to send a
second NoteOn for the same note number on the same channel before a
NoteOff for the first NoteOn. It is more or less impossible to do this
with a physical MIDI controller such as a keyboard, but remarkably easy
to trigger when editing in a DAW—simply overlapping two instances of the
same note will do it.</p>
<p>Ardour offers many options for how to deal with instances where two
instances of the same note overlap. Which one to use is a per-session
property and can be modified from Session &gt; Properties &gt; Misc &gt; MIDI
Options.</p>

<p>A patch change is Ardour’s description for a combination of MIDI program
change and bank select messages, that (typically) instruct a synthesizer
or sampler to select a different sound to use on a particular channel.</p>
<p>Patch changes are shown within MIDI regions as small rectangles or
flags, with a vertical line showing where in the region (hence “when”)
this patch change happens.</p>
<div class="section" id="inserting-patch-changes">
<h3>Inserting Patch Changes<a class="headerlink" href="#inserting-patch-changes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To insert a patch change, the <a class="reference external" href="#edit-point-control">edit point</a>
should be located where the patch change should be (within an existing
MIDI region). When right clicking, and from the MIDI region’s context

<h3>Names for Patch Numbers: MIDNAM files<a class="headerlink" href="#names-for-patch-numbers-midnam-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>MIDNAM files assign human-redable names to the “coordinates” (MSB, LSB,
pc) of instruments and controls of MIDI-devices. A number of MIDNAM
files come already pre-bundled with Ardour. Should this not be the case
for your device, you can add your own (see below).</p>
<div class="section" id="selecting-a-device">
<h4>Selecting a device<a class="headerlink" href="#selecting-a-device" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>For the proper names to show up in the “Patch Selector”-dialog, you have
to assign a device to your current track. To do so, hover the lower
border of the tracks header (the mouse-cursor will change to a
“resize-cursor”) and expand it. You’ll see dropdown menus. Select your
device in the menu.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="adding-a-custom-midnam-file">
<h4>Adding a custom MIDNAM-file<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-a-custom-midnam-file" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>MIDNAM-files are XML-Files. You can edit them using your favorite
text-editor. When doing so, please ensure to change the “Model” of the
device, as Ardour will only load each model once (i.e. it will skip
files, if there are clashes).</p>
<p>After you have done modifications to a file, it is a good idea to
validate it. This can be done using the tool <em>xmllint</em> as shown below:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ xmllint --valid --noout myfile.midnam
$ wget http://www.midi.org/dtds/MIDINameDocument10.dtd
$ xmllint --dtdvalid MIDINameDocument10.dtd myfile.midnam
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Once you are satisfied with your file, you have to put it at a location
where Ardour picks it up. The best place would be the (hidden) directory
<a class="reference external" href="#files-and-directories-ardour-knows-about">Ardour configuration
directory</a> subdirectory
patchfiles. in your home-folder. Should the sub-directory <em>patchfiles</em>
not exist yet, just create it. The path and file-names are
case-sensitive. The file should end with “<em>.midnam</em>”.</p>
<p>After restarting Ardour, hit the small Log-button in the upper right
corner of the main window. It should say something like (this is Linux,
Macos or Windows will be different):</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">INFO</span><span class="p">]:</span> <span class="n">Loading</span> <span class="mi">3</span> <span class="n">MIDI</span> <span class="n">patches</span> <span class="kn">from</span> <span class="o">/</span><span class="n">home</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">username</span><span class="o">/.</span><span class="n">config</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">ardour5</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">patchfiles</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The added device should now show up in the dropdown mentioned in the
previous paragraph.</p>
<p>Should the MIDNAM-file be useful for the general public, it would be
nice to share it: Fork the Ardour-project on
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Ardour/ardour">gitHub</a> by hitting the
“Fork”-Button. Go to the patchfiles-directory (and read the README).</p>

<p>When copying a MIDI region, Ardour has to decide whether to make the
copy refer to the same data as the original or not. If it does refer to
the same data, then editing either the copy or the original will affect
the both of them. If it refers to an independent copy of the data then
each one can be edited without affecting the other.</p>

used to control the default behaviour when making a copy of a MIDI

<p>Changing the status of this option has no effect on the existing

<p>Note that the copied data only covers the extent of the region when the
copy is made. If the region was already trimmed and then a copy is made,
an independent copy will have no access to data that is earlier or later

making an independent copy of a trimmed MIDI region only retains the

<p>Adding pitch bending or aftertouch can add a lot of subtlety to an
otherwise plain sounding midi region and help humanize it.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id553">
<img alt="Automation: pitch bending" src="_images/MIDI_pitch_bending.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Automation: pitch bending</span></p>
</div>
<p>Pitch bending and aftertouch both work the same way, through automation,
by right clicking the MIDI track’s header &gt; Automation &gt; Bender (or
Pressure) &gt; the channel to bend.</p>
<p>Using the Draw tool, as for all the automation, allows to create a
gradual change from one drawn point to another. A line in the center
produces no change to the pitch, while a line above the center will bend
the pitch to a higher note (up to 4 semitones) and a line going under
the middle will bend the pitch to a lower note.</p>
<p>The values can be anything between 0 (-4 semitones) to 16383 (+4
semitones). No automation or a value of 8192 means no pitch shifting.</p>
<p>Aftertouch works very similarly, though the values are between 0 and
127. It should be noted that aftertouch differs from velocity, as
aftertouch allows to slightly change the timbre or create a vibrato,
while the velocity sets the power with which the note is played (e.g. on
a keyboard, the key is hit).</p>

<div class="section" id="transforming-midi-mathematical-operations">
<span id="id30"></span><h2>62 - Transforming MIDI-Mathematical operations<a class="headerlink" href="#transforming-midi-mathematical-operations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Considering the numerical nature of MIDI events, it can be tempting to
apply mathematical transformations to our MIDI regions by using
mathematical operations. Ardour makes it very easy and powerful with the
Transform tool.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id554">
<img alt="MIDI transformation" src="_images/MIDI_transform.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">MIDI transformation</span></p>
</div>
<p>To access the Transform tool, right click the MIDI region &gt;
<em>name_of_the_region</em> &gt; MIDI &gt; Transform…</p>
<p>First, select the property you want to modify in the ‘Set’ field, then
change the target value using the 2 following fields. If you want to add
more operands, click the “+” sign to create new lines. You can remove a
superfluous line using the “-” sign on the right of the newly created
line.</p>
<p>In the picture above, the Transform tool has been used to add a bit of
humanisation, by slightly changing the velocity of each note of the
region, by a random number between -19 and +19 from its original
velocity. So three operations are applied:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Set velocity to this note’s velocity</li>
<li><ul class="first">
<li>a random number from 1 to 20</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul class="first">
<li>a random number from 1 to 20</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each note will trigger a calculation of its own, so its velocity will be
increased by a random number between 1 and 20, then decreased by a
random number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p>The properties that can be computed are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>note number (e.g. C2 is note number 24, C#2 is 25 and <a class="reference external" href="#midi-notes-ref">so
on</a>)</li>
<li>velocity (the global intensity of the note, between 0 and 127)</li>
<li>start time (in beats)</li>
<li>length (in beats)</li>
<li>channel</li>
</ul>
<p>and the calculation may be based on the following properties:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>this note’s</li>
<li>the previous note’s</li>
<li>this note’s index (number of the note, i.e. the first one is 0, the
second is 1, etc.)</li>
<li>exactly (for a constant value, between 1 and 127)</li>
<li>a random number from <em>lower</em> to <em>higher</em> (<em>lower</em> and <em>higher</em> being
constant values between 1 and 127)</li>
<li>equal steps from <em>lower</em> to <em>higher</em> (<em>lower</em> and <em>higher</em> being
constant values between 1 and 127)</li>
</ul>
<p>The mathematical operators can be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><ul class="first">
<li>(addition)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul class="first">
<li>(subtraction)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>* (multiplication)</li>
<li>/ (euclidian division)</li>
<li>mod (remainder of the euclidian division).</li>
</ul>
<p>All these operations can be very handy, as long as there is a
mathematical way to achieve the targeted goal. Beware though of odd
“border cases”: division by zero (which does nothing), using the note’s
index and forgetting it starts at 0 and not 1, etc.</p>
<p>Very interesting results can nevertheless be created, like humanizing
(randomizing the velocity, start time and duration of all the notes),
creating arpeggios, automating tedious tasks, transposing, etc.</p>

<p>Ardour is capable of being used to both record and deliver MIDI “scene”

“scenes” on a variety of external equipment (or software), including
lighting and other audio/video tools. A common use case is to
automatically change presets between songs or to change lighting
conditions based on a specific position on the timeline.</p>
<p>Each change from one scene to another is represented by a marker in the

<h2>67.1 - Tempo and Meter<a class="headerlink" href="#tempo-and-meter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Tempo and meter belong together. Without both, there is no way to know
where a beat lies in time.</p>
<p>Tempo provides a musical pulse, which is divided into beats and bars by
a meter. When tempo is changed or an audio-locked meter is moved, all
objects on the timeline that are glued to bars and beats (locations,
regions) will move in sympathy.</p>
<p>When performing meter or tempo operations, it is advisable to use the
BBT ruler (available by right-clicking an existing marker or ruler
name), and ensure that the constraint modifier is set (in
Preferences-&gt;User Interaction) so that no other modifiers share its key
combination. The constraint modifier is the “Constrain drags using: ”
setting under the “When Beginning a Drag” heading. One viable setting is
.</p>
<div class="section" id="tempo">
<h3>Tempo<a class="headerlink" href="#tempo" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Tempo can be adjusted in several ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>by double clicking on a tempo marker. This opens the tempo dialog
which allows entering the tempo directly into an entry box.</li>
<li>by using the constraint modifier (which is set in Preferences-&gt;User
Interaction) to drag the beat/bars in the BBT ruler or the
tempo/meter lines. This is the preferred way to match the tempo to
previously recorded material.</li>
<li>by holding down the constraint modifier while dragging a tempo
vertically. This is used for more complex tempo solving, as it allows
changing of the position and tempo of a tempo marker in the same
drag; it is, however, a useful way to adjust the first tempo for a
quick result.</li>
</ul>
<p>A tempo may be locked to audio or musical time. This can be changed by
right-clicking on a tempo. If a tempo is locked to music, an entry will
be available to lock it to audio. Similarly an audio-locked tempo may be
locked to music by right-clicking it and selecting the “Lock to Music”
entry.</p>
<p>Audio locked tempo marks stay in their frame position as their
neighbour’s positions are altered. Their pulse (musical) position will
change as their neighbours move. Music locked tempo marks move their
frame position as their neighbours are moved, but keep their pulse
position (they will move as the music is moved).</p>
<p>A tempo may be constant or ramped:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A constant tempo will keep the session tempo constant until the next
tempo section, at which time it will jump instantly to the next
tempo. These are mostly useful abrupt changes, and is the way in
which traditional DAWs deal with tempo changes (abrupt jumps in
tempo).</li>
<li>A ramped tempo increases its tempo over time so that when the next
tempo section has arrived, the session tempo is the same as the
second one. This is useful for matching the session tempo to music
which has been recorded without a metronome. Ramps may also be used
as a compositional tool, but more on this later. Note that a ramp
requires two points—a start and an end tempo. The first tempo in a
new session is ramped, but appears to be constant as it has no tempo
to ramp to. It is only when a new tempo is added and one of them is
adjusted that a ramp will be heard. The same applies to the last
tempo in the session—it will always appear to be constant until a new
last tempo is added and changed.</li>
</ul>
<p>To add a new tempo, use the primary modifier and click on the tempo line
at the desired position. The new tempo will be the same as the tempo at
the position of the mouse click (it will not change the shape of the
ramp).</p>
<p>To copy a tempo, hold down the primary modifier and drag the tempo to be
copied.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="meter">
<h3>Meter<a class="headerlink" href="#meter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Meter positions beats using the musical pulse of a tempo, and groups
them into bars using its number of divisions per bar.</p>
<p>The first meter in a new session may be moved freely. It has an
associated tempo which cannot be dragged by itself (although all others
can). It can be moved freely and is locked to audio.</p>
<p>New meters are locked to music. They may only occur on a bar line if
music locked.</p>
<p>An audio locked meter provides a way to cope with musical passages which
have no meter (rubato, pause), or to allow a film composer to insert a
break in music which cannot be counted in beats.</p>
<p>If a meter is audio-locked, its bar number is fixed from the point at
which it left the main score. That bar number cannot be changed, nor can
tempo motion allow the previous bar to overlap. If another bar is
needed, lock the meter to music again (right click-&gt;”Lock to Music”),
drag the meter to the desired bar and re-lock to audio. The new bar can
be freely dragged again.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>To change a meter, double click it. A dialog will appear.</li>
<li>To copy a meter, hold down and drag it.</li>

</div>
<p>As a general approach, the best way to control tempo ramps is to use
them in pairs.</p>
<p>One typical use of tempo ramps is to match the click to a drum
performance recorded in ‘free time’, like in the (admittedly bad) 4/4
example on the left.</p>
<div class="section" id="step-1-first-meter">

<p>Now the first click will be in time with the first beat. By listening to
the recorded drums, the position of bar <em>n</em> (here, 9th beat, 3rd bar) is
visually located (the playhead may be moved to this location to “pin”
it).</p>

<p>Holding the constraint modifier ( by default), the third bar marker in
the BBT ruler is dragged at the position of the third bar in the
recording (where the playhead is located). This drag can be done either
in the Meter or in the Tempo rulers. The tempo (on the first and only
tempo marker) reflects the new value based on this change.</p>
<p>The click now matches the first 8 beats, but after that it can wander
off, which will be reflected in the tempo lines thet won’t quite match
the drum hits.</p>

</div>
<p>Although it may be unnecessary in some cases where the tempo changes
abruptly, most of the time, the tempo change is progressive in time,
like an instrumentist drifting in tempo. In those cases, the tempo
change should be progressive too, and Ardour allows that by ramping the
tempo change.</p>
<p>right clicking the first tempo marker, a menu appears, allowing to Ramp
to Next. This will make the tempo between the two markers linearly
change from the first marker’s value to the second’s.</p>
<p>Again, some time later the click will probably drift again, so the same
technique has to be repeated: adding two new tempos and dragging the BBT
ruler <strong>after</strong> the newest tempo so that the beats align with the audio
again.</p>
<p>In a general sense, adding tempo markers in pairs allows to ‘pin’ the
tempo at the marker’s location while moving further to the right.</p>

<h3>Other use cases<a class="headerlink" href="#other-use-cases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Audio locked meters can be useful when composing, as they allow a
continuous piece of music to be worked on in isolated segments,
preventing the listening fatigue of a fixed form. Reassembly is left as
an excercise for the reader.</p>
<p>Tempo ramps can also be used in a video context, e.g. for an
accelerando, by snapping to TC frames and dragging the ruler so that a
bar ends up on a significant video frame.</p>

<h3>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>An engineer reading and using audio level meters compares to a musician
reading or writing sheet-music. Just like there are virtuoso musicians
who can’t read a single note, there are great sound-engineers who just
go by their ears and produce great mixes and masters without ever
looking at a single meter.</p>
<p>Yet, in order to work in or with the broadcast industry, it is usually
unavoidable to use meters.</p>
<p>Audio level meters are very powerful tools that are useful in every part
of the entire production chain:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>When tracking, meters are used to ensure that the input signal does
not overload and maintains reasonable headroom.</li>
<li>Meters offer a quick visual indication of an activity when working
with a large number of tracks.</li>
<li>During mixing, meters provide an rough estimate of the loudness of
each track.</li>
<li>At the mastering stage, meters are used to check compliance with
upstream level and loudness standards and to optimize the loudness
range for a given medium.</li>

that end, DPMs are always
calibrated to 0&nbsp;dBFS, or the
maximum level that can be
represented digitally in a given
system. This value has no musical
reason whatsoever and depends
only on the properties of the
signal chain or target medium.
There are conventions for

broadcasters in particular so
that the interchange of material
is uniform across their sphere of
influence, regardless of the
equipment used to play it back.</p>
<p>For home recording, there is no
real need for this level of

<div class="section" id="signal-routing">
<h2>68.2 - Signal Routing<a class="headerlink" href="#signal-routing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ardour does most of its internal signal routing via JACK: all track and
bus inputs and outputs are JACK ports, as are sends and inserts, which
means they can be tapped into by other JACK clients. Only the signal
flow inside a track or bus (i.e. from <a class="reference external" href="#processor-box">processor to
processor</a>) is handled internally.</p>
<p>By default, Ardour will automatically create the following connections:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Track inputs are optionally auto-connected to hardware inputs, in
round robin order, depending on the setting chosen in the <a class="reference external" href="#newopen-session-dialog">Session &gt;
New Session dialog</a>.</li>
<li>Bus inputs are left disconnected.</li>
<li>The number of track and bus outputs are equal to the number of inputs
of the master bus.</li>
<li>Track and bus outputs are always auto-connected to the master bus
inputs.</li>
<li>Master bus outputs are connected to hardware outputs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This configuration is sufficient to do basic tracking and playback of
many sessions without any adjustment by the user. Changing these
connections is generally not necessary and often leads to problems.</p>
<p>However, for many workflows during mixing, more complicated signal
routing is required. Ardour offers many possibilities for connecting
things to fit any particular workflow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="aux-sends">
<h2>68.3 - Aux Sends<a class="headerlink" href="#aux-sends" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Auxiliary sends are simple <a class="reference external" href="#processor-box">processors</a> in a bus or
track channel strip. They tap the signal at a specific point in the
signal flow (pre-fader, post-fader, before or after EQs and other
plugins, etc.) and send a copy of that signal to a bus, without
affecting the normal signal flow downwards to the channel fader.</p>
<p>Aux sends from several tracks are collectively sent to a bus in Ardour,
to create a monitor mix for a musician, or to feed an effect unit. A bus
used in this way is considered an auxiliary bus or Aux bus even though
it is the same as any other bus. The output of such a bus might be
routed to separate hardware outputs (in the case of headphone or monitor
wedge mixes), or returned to the main mix (in the case of an effect).</p>
<p>Aux sends are not JACK ports, <a class="reference external" href="#external-sends">External Sends</a>
should be used to send audio to Jack ports. External Sends can send the
tapped signal somewhere else directly, which is not usually possible on
hardware mixers.</p>
<p>It may be useful to <a class="reference external" href="#comparing-aux-sends-and-subgroups">compare and

<h4>Pre-fader and Post-fader Aux Sends<a class="headerlink" href="#pre-fader-and-post-fader-aux-sends" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Depending on whether the context-click happened above or below the fader
in the processor box, the new aux send can be placed before or after the
fader in the channel strip.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Post-fader aux sends are typically used when using an aux for shared
signal processing (FX), so that the amount of effect is always
proportional to the main mix fader.</li>
<li>Pre-fader sends ensure that the level sent to the bus is controlled
<em>only</em> by the send, not the main fader—this is typical when
constructing headphone and monitor wedge mixes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The color of the processor will reflect this pre/post position (red for
Pre, green for Post). Dragging and dropping the send inside the

fader accordingly.</p>

the channel strip for every track or bus that feeds the aux bus. Many
aspects of the strip will become insensitive and/or change their visual

<h2>68.4 - Comparing Aux Sends and Subgroups<a class="headerlink" href="#comparing-aux-sends-and-subgroups" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Auxes and Subgroups share a common concept—they both provide a way for
one or more tracks (or busses) to send their signal to a single bus so
that common signal processing can be applied to the mix of their
signals.</p>
<p>Aux sends leave the existing signal routing to the main mix in place,
and are typically used to create a separate mix to send to (for example)
monitors or headphones (for performer monitor mixes):</p>

send has no effect whatsoever on the audio signals within Ardour—it is a
one-way signal routing that leaves all existing signal processing just

<h2>68.7 - Subgrouping<a class="headerlink" href="#subgrouping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Subgrouping (sometimes known as “Grouping” or “Audio Grouping”) is a way
to collect related signals together to apply some common treatment,
before sending them on to the main mix. One standard application is to
group several tracks belonging to the same instrument or section (such
as a drum kit or horn section), to be able to adjust their volume with a
single fader, after their inner balance has been set using the track
faders.</p>
<p>Ardour also provides <a class="reference external" href="#control-masters-mixer-strips">VCAs</a> that is a
very flexible way to adjust the volume of a group of tracks/busses when
no additionnal processing is needed.</p>
<p>Create a subgroup from an existing Track/Bus group is done by
right-clicking on the relevant <a class="reference external" href="#the-track-and-bus-group-list">group
tab</a>, and choosing Add new subgroup
bus. A new bus will be created and every member of the track group will
have its outputs disconnected from other destinations and then connected
to the new bus inputs. The bus outputs will feed the master bus unless
manual connections have been selected in the session preferences. The
bus will be named after the track group name.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a group can be created manually, by first adding a new
bus, then, for each track to be fed in the subgroup bus, disconnecting
its outputs from the master and connecting it to the inputs of the
subgroup bus instead. This can be done in the global audio patchbay or
on a track by track basis via the output button of each track’s channel
strip.</p>
<p>Remove a subgroup (bus) is done by right -clicking on the track group
tab, and selecting Remove subgroup bus. Simply deleting the bus itself
will <strong>not</strong> restore signal routing to the way it was before the
addition of the subgroup bus—tracks that had been subgrouped will be
left with their main outputs disconnected.</p>

<img alt="An example patchbay" src="_images/connection-manager.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">An example patchbay</span></p>
</div>
<p>The patchbay is the main way to make connections to, from and within
Ardour’s mixer.</p>
<p>Notable exceptions are internal aux sends and connections to the monitor
bus (when using one): these cannot be controlled from a patchbay, and
are basically not under manual control at all.</p>
<p>The patchbay presents two groups of ports; one set of sources (which
produce data), and one of destinations (which consume data). Depending
on the relative number of each, the sources will be placed on the left
or the top of the dialogue, and the destinations on the right or the
bottom. Thus, in general, signal flow is from top or left to right or
bottom.</p>
<p>Both sources and destinations are divided up into groups, with each
group being given a tab:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Hardware</td>
<td>These are ports which are
connected to a physical piece of
hardware (a sound card or MIDI
interface).</td>

<tr class="row-even"><td>Ardour Busses</td>
<td>All ports belonging to busses.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Ardour Tracks</td>
<td>All ports belonging to tracks.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Ardour Misc</td>
<td>These are other ports that do not
fit into the previous two
categories; for example, the
ports on which the metronome
click is output, and MIDI ports
for things like control surfaces
and timecode.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Other</td>
<td>If there are other JACK clients
running, their ports will be
found here. If there are no such
ports, the tab will not exist (on
one or both axes of the grid).</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The main part of the patchbay is a matrix grid. Within this grid, green
dots represent connections, and any of the squares can be clicked on to
make or break connections. Clicking and dragging draws a line of
connections, which is sometimes useful for making many connections at
once.</p>
<p>In the example patchbay shown above we can note various things. We are
using the Ardour Tracks sources tab, so we see the output ports of the
three tracks in our session: Fred, Jim and Foo. Our destinations are
from the Ardour Busses tab, so we have the inputs of a session bus,
Sheila, and the inputs of the master bus. Fred and Jim have stereo
outputs, so have L and R connections. Foo is a MIDI track, so it only
has one connection, and its squares in the grid are coloured light grey
to indicate that no connection can be made between Foo (a MIDI output)
and our busses (which are all audio-input).</p>
<p>The green dots in the example show that both Fred and Jim are connected
to the master bus, left to left and right to right.</p>

<p>Slightly different versions of the patchbay are available from different
places in Ardour. A global view of all JACK audio connections is
available, in Window &gt; Audio Connections, or by pressing P. A
corresponding MIDI Connection Manager can be opened using P.</p>
<p>There is also a patchbay available when connecting individual tracks;
clicking on the input or output buttons of a mixer strip will open a
connection manager which has the corresponding track input or output as
the only destination or source, with all other ports available for
connection to it.</p>

<tr class="row-even"><td>Rescan</td>
<td>Ardour will try to keep abreast

or Ambisonics). To make life
easier with such sessions, Show
individual ports can be unticked.
After that, the channels of
tracks and busses will be hidden,
and any green dots added in the
connection manager will
automatically connect each
channel of the source to the
corresponding channel of the
destination (left to left, right

mode, a half-circle in the
connection grid indicates that
some (but not all) of the
source’s ports are connected to
the destination.</td>

<h3>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<img alt="Typical signal routing in a channel strip." src="_images/track_signal_routing.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Typical signal routing in a channel strip.</span></p>
</div>
<p>In each individual Track or Bus the signal flow is top to bottom, as
shown in the diagram on the right.</p>
<p>Trim, Fader and Panner are provided by Ardour. The Processor Box can
hold third party plugins or host-provided redirects (insert, aux-send,
etc.).</p>
<p>An important aspect is that the signal flow is multi-channel and not
fixed throughout the track. For example, a track can have a mono input,
a mono to stereo plugin (e.g. reverb) flowing into a surround panner
with 6 outputs.</p>
<p>The design of Ardour is that the width of the signal flow is defined by
the passage through plugins in the processor box, followed by panning.
The number of inputs to the panner is defined by the number of outputs
of the last plugin in the chain. The number of panner outputs is equal
to the track’s outputs ports, which can be added and removed
dynamically. This schema is called <em>Flexible I/O</em>. It is very powerful
and a distinctive feature of Ardour.</p>
<p>The golden rule of processor signal flow: The number of outputs of one
link of the process chain defines the number of inputs of the next,
until the panner.</p>
<p>Due to this rule there is one very common case that is hard to achieve:
keeping a mono track mono. With <em>Flexible I/O</em>, if a stereo plugin is
added on a mono track, the signal flow after that plugin becomes stereo.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="strict-i-o">
<h3>Strict I/O<a class="headerlink" href="#strict-i-o" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Strict I/O enforces a simple rule: plugins have the same number of
inputs as they have outputs. By induction the track will have as many
output ports as there are input ports.</p>
<p>Adding a plugin will not modify the signal flow. The number of plugin
outputs is forced to the number of inputs present at the point of
insertion. If a plugin pin is missing, it is ignored. If a plugin pin is
not connected, it is fed with silence. Non-connected plugin outputs are
ignored.</p>
<p>Strict I/O enforces the number of output ports. The number of inputs to
the panner (outputs of last plugin) defines the number of track outputs
(after panner). Required ports are automatically added, excess ports are
removed. The user cannot manually add or remove output ports.</p>
<p>Strict I/O is set when creating the track and can later be enabled or
disabled dynamically in the context menu of every mixer strip.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id572">
<img alt="Flexible vs. Strict I/O." src="_images/strict_io_routing.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Flexible vs. Strict I/O.</span></p>
</div>
<p>There are two exceptions to the above rule:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Midi Synths. When adding a synth at a point where there is a Midi
port only, the synthesizer plugin will add audio output ports, which
trickle down the processor chain to all follow up plugins as inputs
and in turn force their outputs to match</li>
<li>Side chain inputs are not affected by Strict I/O</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="customizing-the-signal-flow-the-pin-connection-window">
<h3>Customizing the Signal Flow: The Pin Connection window<a class="headerlink" href="#customizing-the-signal-flow-the-pin-connection-window" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The signal flow though the mixer can be customized at every processor
node via Pin Configuration in the context menu of every processor. User
customization overrides all automatic (Flexible and Strict I/O mode)
inferred output port settings.</p>
<p>The Pin Connection window is made of three vertical sections:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>an I/O config column</li>
<li>an interactive diagram</li>
<li>a sidechain column</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the I/O config is set to <em>Automatic</em>, i.e. the Manual Config
LED light is turned off. In this mode, the diagram will display the
standard input/outputs for this plugin, i.e. the number of ports (inputs
&amp; outputs) is equal to the number of pins on the plugin, and a
one-to-one connection is automatically created.</p>
<p>Adding new instances of the plugin allows to apply this plugin to more
inputs or outputs. E.g., a mono effect can be applied to each channel of
a <em>n</em>-channels track by adding as many instances of the plugins as there
are input channels (i.e. ports). This happens automatically when adding,
e.g., a mono effect to a stereo track:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ardour creates two instances of the plugin</li>
<li>the plugin gets a (2x1) label in the processor box</li>
<li>its two input ports are each connected to one pin of an instance</li>
<li>each mono output pin of the plugin is connected to one output port</li>
</ul>
<p>Output channels can also, in Manual Config mode, be added or removed,
whether they are audio or MIDI.</p>
<p>Using the Pin Connection overrides the I/O config setting (Flexible vs.
Strict). A processor <em>can</em>, even in Strict I/O mode, have a different
number of outputs than inputs. Non-customized plugins downstream will
follow suit depending on the selected route mode. e.g. adding an
additional output to a plugin on a track set to Strict I/O will trickle
down the process chain to the output and result in the addition of an
output port. This is useful for example in case of a mono to stereo
reverb.</p>
<p>The window allows connection of the I/O ports to the plugin pins and
other I/O ports, provided they are compatible (MIDI vs. audio), just by
dragging and dropping the end connectors on top of one another. A dotted
connector’s line is a “<em>thru</em>” line that directly connects an input to
an output without connecting to a pin on the plugin—hence without any
audio modification. These “thru” connections are latency compensated,
with respect to those being affected by the plugin, in order to avoid
phasing issues.</p>
<p>An example of using “thru” connections, shown below, is separate
left/right channel equalization using two mono plugins on a stereo
track:</p>
<div class="figure" id="id573">

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">An example of using two mono plugins on a stereo track.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The only way to add inputs to a processor is via
<a class="reference external" href="#sidechaining">Sidechaining</a> from another signal. This is done by
“tapping” the signal from another track or bus at any point.</p>
<p>Adding a sidechain signal in Ardour is as simple as enabling the Side
Chain button in the Pin Configuration window, and choosing an Audio or
MIDI sidechain in the Add Sidechain Input lower right hand section. A
new drop-down menu appears, which displays a list of the tracks/busses
available to be sidechained, or, for a more complex setup (e.g.
sidechaining from hardware directly), the <a class="reference external" href="#patchbay">Routing Grid</a>
(also accessible with a Right-click on the drop-down menu).</p>
<p>The sidechain ports can then be connected, as other inputs, to a pin of
the plugin, or an output port as a “thru”.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sidechaining">
<h2>68.10 - Sidechaining<a class="headerlink" href="#sidechaining" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Dynamic Processors—such as compressors—in general use the the original
input signal for analysis and operate on the same signal. Side-chaining
uses the signal level of <em>another input</em> to control the compression
level of the original signal.</p>
<p>Effect Processors which have a side-chain input (sometimes also called
<em>key input</em>) have an additional input pin to receive a signal from an
external input. In Ardour that extra input can be connected in the
plugin’s Pin Configuration dialog: the signal from one track can be
tapped off and used as an input to a plugin on a different track. This
dialog is accessed via the plugin’s context-menu &gt; Pin Connections….</p>
<p>In case a plugin has a dedicated sidechain input, Ardour automatically
creates a port for the input. This is a normal I/O port which can be fed
by any external signal. The Pin Configuration dialog is not limited to
processors with a dedicated sidechain input, it also allows to manually
create (or remove) a sidechain input port and provides for flexible
connection of the signal to plugin pins.</p>
<p>The operational flow in the Ardour GUI starts at the processor which is
to receive the signal: a sidechain source is selected, and Ardour
creates a dedicated send-processor in the source processor box, the
level of which can be adjusted either in the Pin Configuration window or
directly on the source’s send.</p>
<div class="section" id="a-simple-example-sidechain-compression">
<h3>A simple example: Sidechain compression<a class="headerlink" href="#a-simple-example-sidechain-compression" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One example is the use of a bass drum track to trigger the compression
on a bass track. The sidechain compressor (a-Compressor) will be placed
on the bass track, and will need to receive the signal from the bass
drum track as a way to trigger the compression.</p>
<p>Here, on the bass track, an <em>a-Compressor</em> has been added, and the Drum
track has been set as the sidechain source. The mixer reflects this by
showing an <em>SC</em>-send processor in the drum track, very similar to a
<a class="reference external" href="#aux-sends">send</a>. The bass track also shows an arrow as one of the
a-compressor input.</p>
<p>As a result, in the editor, each peak in the kick drum track triggers
the compression on the bass track and the resulting track shows the
compression kicking in on each kick drum peak, hence reducing the gain.
The compression is applied to the bass, but only based on the level of
the drum track.</p>
<p>This is commonly used for <em>ducking</em> effect, when e.g. a radio speaker’s
voice triggers the compression on the audio playing.</p>

<div class="section" id="midi-sidechaining">
<h3>MIDI Sidechaining<a class="headerlink" href="#midi-sidechaining" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Ardour allows the sidechain sources to be either audio or MIDI
tracks/busses. This is particularly useful when a MIDI signal is used to
control an audio effect, like a vocoder or an auto-tuner, like
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/x42/fat1.lv2">fat1</a>, the LV2 port of Fons

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">MIDI sidechaining example: fat1.lv2.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Here, the MIDI track is inputted to the plugin’s MIDI IN pin through a
sidechain, indicating to the plugin what note the source audio should be
corrected to.</p>
<p>Notice that in the example above, the output of the “Vocals” track is
connected to the input of the “Corrected” track. We could have chosen to
insert the “Vocals” track content as an audio sidechain too, totally
disconnecting the input from the plugin, and connecting the plugin’s
input pin to the audio sidechain port.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pre-processing-the-sidechained-signal">
<h3>Pre-processing the sidechained signal<a class="headerlink" href="#pre-processing-the-sidechained-signal" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes, the effects of a sidechain signal on a plugin can be enhanced
by pre-processing the signal.</p>
<p>In the first example above, if the entire drum part is on one track,
then compressing with this signal as a sidechain will result in every
peak triggering the compression, be they bass drum kicks or snare,
cymbals, etc.</p>
<p>In this case, adding an EQ to the drum track with a low pass filter
would filter out the peaks created by the high pitched instruments of
the drum kit, and allow for a better triggering, though to avoid
damaging the original drum track, a send to an intermediary track would
be better suited to place the EQ on. This track won’t be connected to
the Master, as its content is of no musical interest except for its use
as a trigger, allowing for some extreme EQ.</p>

<h3>Without a monitor bus<a class="headerlink" href="#without-a-monitor-bus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When using Ardour without a monitor bus, there is only one way in which
mute and solo will work:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Mute on a track or bus will mute that track on the master bus, so
that it will not be heard.</li>
<li>Solo on a track or bus will solo that track or bus and mute all
others. Soloing a bus will also solo any tracks or busses which feed
that bus.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="with-a-monitor-bus">
<h3>With a monitor bus<a class="headerlink" href="#with-a-monitor-bus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For setups with a monitor bus, more options are available, mostly
governed by the setting of the Solo controls are Listen controls option
in Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Mixer.</p>
<p>With Solo controls are Listen controls unticked, behaviour is almost
exactly the same as the situation without a monitor bus. Mute and solo
behave the same, and the monitor bus is fed from the master bus, so it
sees the same thing.</p>
<p>With Solo controls are Listen controls ticked, the master and monitor
busses behave differently. In this mode, solo controls are more properly
called listen controls, and Ardour’s solo buttons will change their
legend from S to either A or P to reflect this.</p>
<p>Now, without any mute or listen, the monitor bus remains fed by the
master bus. Also:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Mute will mute the track or bus, so that it will not be heard
anywhere (neither on the master nor monitor busses), much as before.</li>
<li>Listen will disconnect the monitor bus from the master bus, so that
the monitor bus now only receives things that are “listened to”.
Listen will not perform any muting, and hence the master bus will not
be affected by a listened track or bus.</li>
</ul>
<p>When solo controls are listen controls, the listening point can be set
to either After-Fade Listen (AFL) or Pre-Fade Listen (PFL). The precise
point to get the signal from can further be configured using the PFL
signals come from and AFL signals come from options.</p>
<p>The solo-mute arrangement with a monitor bus is shown below:</p>
<div class="figure" id="id575">
<img alt="Mute/solo signal flow" src="_images/solo-mute.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Mute/solo signal flow</span></p>
</div>
<p>Here we have a number of tracks or busses (in orange). Each one has an
output which feeds the master bus. In addition, each has PFL and AFL
outputs; we have a choice of which to use. PFL/AFL from each track or
bus are mixed. Then, whenever anything is set to AFL/PFL, the monitor
out becomes just those AFL/PFL feeds; the rest of the time, the monitor
out is fed from the master bus.</p>
<p>In this scheme Solo has no effect other than to mute other non-soloed
tracks; with solo (rather than listen), the monitor out is fed from the
master bus.</p>

<h4>Solo-in-place mute cut<a class="headerlink" href="#solo-in-place-mute-cut" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>When using solo-in-place (SiP), in other words when soloed tracks are
being listened to on the master bus, this fader specifies the gain that
will be applied to other tracks in order to mute them. Setting this
level to -∞&nbsp;dB will mean that other tracks will not be heard at all;
setting to some higher value less than 0dB means that other non-soloed
tracks will be heard, just reduced in volume compared to the soloed
tracks. Using a value larger than -∞&nbsp;dB is sometimes called
“Solo-In-Front” by other DAWs, because the listener has the sense that
soloed material is “in front” of other material. In Ardour, this is not
a distinct mode, but instead the mute cut control offers any level of
“in-front-ness” that is desired.</p>

<h2>68.12 - Panning<a class="headerlink" href="#panning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Panning is the process of distributing one or more signals across a
series of outputs so that the listener will have the experience of them
coming from a particular point or area of the overall listening field.</p>
<p>It is used to create a sense of space and/or a sense of motion in an
audio mix. Different signals can be spread out across the space, and
moved over time.</p>
<div class="section" id="types-of-panners">
<h3>Types of Panners<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-panners" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The way a panner works depends a great deal on how many signals it is
going to process and how many outputs it will send them to. The simplest
case is distributing a single signal to 2 outputs, which is the common
case when using a “mono” track and a stereo speaker setup.</p>
<p>But panning in Ardour could theoretically involve distributing any
number of signals to any number of outputs. In reality, Ardour does not
have specific panners for each different situation. Currently, it has
dedicated panners for the following situations:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>1 signal distributed to 2 outputs (the <a class="reference external" href="#mono-panner">mono
panner</a>)</li>
<li>2 signals distributed to 2 outputs (the <a class="reference external" href="#stereo-panner">stereo
panner</a>)</li>
<li>N signals distributed to M outputs (the <a class="reference external" href="#vbap-panner">VBAP
panner</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Even for each of these cases, there are many different ways to implement
panning. Ardour currently offers just one solution to each of these
situations, but in the future will offer more.</p>
<p>In addition to the panners, Ardour has a balance control for subtle
corrections to existing stereo images.</p>

<p>The panner user interface consists of three elements, divided between
the top and bottom half. Clicking and/or dragging in the top half
controls position; clicking and/or dragging in the bottom half controls
width (see below for details).</p>
<p>In the top half is the position indicator, which shows where the center
of the stereo image is relative to the left and right edges. When this
is the middle of the panner, the stereo image is centered between the
left and right outputs. When it all the way to the left, the stereo
image collapses to just the left speaker.</p>
<p>In the bottom half are two signal indicators, one marked L and the other
R. The distance between these two shows the width of the stereo image.
If the width is reduced to zero, there will only be a single signal
indicator marked M (for mono), whose color will change to indicate this
special state.</p>
<p>It is possible to invert the outputs (see below) so that whatever would
have gone to the right channel goes to the left and vice versa. When
this happens, the entire movable part of the panner changes color to
indicate clearly that this is the case.</p>

<h3>Stereo panning caveats<a class="headerlink" href="#stereo-panning-caveats" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">The stereo panner will introduce unwanted side effects on material
that includes a time difference between the channels, such as A/B,
ORTF or NOS microphone recordings, or delay-panned mixes.</div>
<div class="line">When the width is reduced, two highly correlated signals with a delay
are effectively summed, which will cause comb filtering.</div>
</div>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at what happens when a source is recorded at
45° to the right side with an ORTF stereo microphone array and then the
width manipulated.</p>
<p>For testing, we apply a pink noise signal to both inputs of an Ardour
stereo bus with the stereo panner, and feed the bus output to a
two-channel analyser. Since pink noise contains equal energy per octave,
the expected readout is a straight line, which would indicate that our
signal chain does not color the sound:</p>
<div class="figure" id="id579">
<img alt="Stereo panner with ORTF full width" src="_images/stereo-panner-with-ORTF-fullwidth.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Stereo panner with ORTF full width</span></p>
</div>
<p>An ORTF is simulated using Robin Gareus’ stereo balance control LV2 to
set the level difference and time delay. The Trim/Gain can be
ignored—its purpose is just to align the test signal with the 0dB line
of the analyser.</p>
<p>An ORTF microphone pair consists of two cardioids spaced 17&nbsp;cm apart,
with an opening angle of 110°. For a far source at 45° to the right, the
time difference between the capsules is 350&nbsp;μs or approximately 15
samples at 44.1&nbsp;kHz. The level difference due to the directivity of the
microphones is about 7.5&nbsp;dB (indicated by the distance between the blue
and red lines in the analyser).</p>
<p>Now for the interesting part: if the width of the signal is reduced to
50%, the time-delayed signals will be combined in the panner. What
happens to the frequency response of the left and right outputs is shown
in the following picture:</p>
<div class="figure" id="id580">
<img alt="Stereo panner with ORTF half width" src="_images/stereo-panner-with-ORTF-halfwidth.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Stereo panner with ORTF half width</span></p>
</div>
<p>It can be argued that all spaced microphone recordings will undergo comb
filtering later, when the two channels recombine in the air between the
speakers. Perceptually however, there is a huge difference: our hearing
system is very good at eliminating comb filters in the real world, where
their component signals are spatially separated. But once they are
combined inside a signal chain, this spatial separation is lost and the
brain will no longer be able to sort out the timbral mess.</p>
<p>Depending on the material and on how much the width needs to be
manipulated, some degree of comb filtering may be acceptable. Then
again, it may not. It is advised to listen carefully for artefacts when
manipulating unknown stereo signals—many orchestra sample libraries for
example do contain time-delay components.</p>

<h2>68.16 - VBAP Panner<a class="headerlink" href="#vbap-panner" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Ardour’s VBAP panner is currently in development, and its semantics
may change in the near future, possibly affecting mixes using it. It
is advised not to rely on it for important production work while the
dust settles.</div>
<div class="line">The Panner only works in fixed static mode, it does not support
automation playback.</div>
</div>
<p>VBAP is a versatile and straightforward method to pan a source around
over an arbitrary number of speakers on a horizontal polygon or a 3D
surface, even if the speaker layout is highly irregular.</p>
<div class="section" id="basic-concepts">
<h3>Basic concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#basic-concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>VBAP was developed by Ville Pulkki at Aalto University, Helsinki, in
1997. It works by distributing the signal to the speakers nearest to the
desired direction with appropriate weightings, aiming to create a
maximally sharp phantom source by using as few speakers as possible:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>one speaker, if the desired direction coincides with a speaker
location,</li>
<li>two speakers, if the desired direction is on the line between two
speakers,</li>
<li>and three speakers in the general 3D case.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, if the panner is moved onto a speaker, only this speaker will get
any signal. This is handy when precise 1:1 routing is needed.</p>
<p>The drawback of VBAP is that a moving source will constantly change its
apparent sharpness, as it transitions between the three states mentioned
above.</p>
<p>An horizontal VBAP panner has one parameter, the azimuth angle. A
full-sphere panner offers an additional elevation angle control.</p>
<p>More elaborate implementations of VBAP also include a spread parameter,
which will distribute the signal over a greater number of speakers in
order to maintain constant (but no longer maximal) sharpness, regardless
of position. Ardour’s VBAP panner does not currently include this
feature.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="speaker-layout">
<h3>Speaker layout<a class="headerlink" href="#speaker-layout" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="mini figure" id="id581">
<img alt="The VBAP panner with 5 outputs" src="_images/VBAP-panner-5.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The VBAP panner with 5 outputs</span></p>
</div>
<p>Each VBAP panner is specific to its speaker layout—the panner has to
“know” about the precise location of all the speakers. A complete VBAP
implementation must therefore include the possibility to define this
layout.</p>
<p>Ardour currently uses a simplified approach: if a track or bus has more
than two output channels (which implies stereo), it assumes that there
are N speakers distributed in a regular N-gon. That means that for

<h3>Adding/Removing/Copying Plugins<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-removing-copying-plugins" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Within Ardour, plugins are just another type of Processor and so the
techniques for adding/removing/copying/moving processors apply to
plugins as well. These techniques are covered on the <a class="reference external" href="#processor-box">Processor
Box</a> page.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id37">
<h2>69.2 - Processor Box<a class="headerlink" href="#id37" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="figure" id="id584">
<img alt="Processor Box." src="_images/processor-box.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Processor Box.</span></p>
</div>
<p>In Ardour terminology, a processor is anything which treats the signal
in some way and gets plugged into a mixer strip. Ardour provides several
builtin processors such as the fader or panners. Processors can also be
plugins used for effects or as instruments, as well as sends or inserts
which affect <a class="reference external" href="#signal-routing">signal routing</a>.</p>
<p>The arrangement of processors is arbitrary, and there is no limit to how
many there can be. The Processor Box will automagically add a scrollbar
to itself if there are more processors in it than can be shown in the
given space.</p>
<p>The main box in the top half of a mixer strip shows the processor box.
Processors are shown as colored rectangles, with a small LED beside them
that lights up when the processor is enabled. The color of the processor
depends on its location in the sequence; processors that are pre-fader
are colored in red, and post-fader processors are colored green (in the
default theme).</p>
<p>The processor box will always contain a blue Fader processor. This
indicates where in the processor chain the main channel fader is
located; this is the fader shown in the lower half of the strip. It can
be enabled and disabled like any other processor.</p>
<div class="section" id="adding-processors">
<h3>Adding Processors<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-processors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Processors can be added to the chain by Right-clicking in the processor
list, This does three things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A gap is opened up to indicate the location of the click. The gap
shows where any new processors will be inserted.</li>
<li>The processor under the click is selected.</li>
<li>An options menu is presented.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the menu, new processors can be inserted.</p>
<p>Processors can also be dragged and dropped from the <a class="reference external" href="#favorite-plugins-window">Favorite Plugins
window</a> to an appropriate spot in the
Processor Box.</p>
<p>The Favorite Plugins window can be populated via the <a class="reference external" href="#plugin-manager">Plugin

package management tool for the system. Most Linux distributions that
are good for audio work will have most of the LADSPA and LV2 plugins
mentioned above available in ready-to-use form.</p>
<p>Finding them will typically require <em>searching</em> the distribution’s
repository to find the name of the package. The tools for doing this
vary from distribution to distribution. A good place to start searching
is with the name of the package (e.g. “caps” or “cmt”). There are no
fixed rules about what different Linux distributions call their packages
for a given set of plugins.</p>
<p>If the package isn’t available, then the plugins can be built from
source (plugins are generally fairly easy to compile and
well-documented).</p>
<p>LADSPA plugins are shared library files. They need to be installed in
either /usr/lib/ladspa, /usr/local/lib/ladspa or in a directory
mentioned in the local LADSPA_PATH environment variable.</p>
<p>LV2 plugins are folders/directories. They need to be installed in either
/usr/lib/lv2, /usr/local/lib/lv2 or a directory mentioned in the local
LV2_PATH environment variable.</p>
<p>Linux VST (LXVST) plugins are distributed as shared library files. They
are typically installed in /usr/lib/lxvst, /usr/local/lib/lxvst or a
directory mentioned in the local LXVST_PATH environment variable.</p>

<h2>69.8 - Using Windows VST Plugins on Linux<a class="headerlink" href="#using-windows-vst-plugins-on-linux" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Thanks to the combined work of Torben Hohn, Kjetil Mattheusen, Paul
Davis and a few other developers, it is possible to use Windows VST
plugins (that is, plugins in VST format built and distributed for the
Windows platforms) on Ardour running on Linux.</p>
<p>However, doing so has three <em>substantial</em> downsides:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It requires a special build of Ardour that is fundamentally very
different from normal builds</li>
<li>Support depends on <a class="reference external" href="http://winehq.org/">Wine</a>, a Windows
“emulator”</li>
<li>As usual with plugins, a crashing plugin will take Ardour down with
it—and crashes in Windows VST plugins are more likely when used in
this way</li>
</ul>
<p>The dependence on Wine makes it almost impossible for the Ardour project
to support this feature. Wine’s functionality generally improves over
time, but any given release of Wine may behave worse with some or all
Windows VST plugins. It may even just crash Ardour completely.</p>
<p>Step back and think about what “using Windows VSTs” really means: taking
bits of software written with only one idea in mind—running on the
Windows platform—and then trying to use them on an entirely different
platform. It is a bit of a miracle (thanks largely to the incredible
work done by the Wine project) that it works at all. But is this the
basis of a stable, reliable DAW for a non-Windows platform? Getting
Ardour on Linux to pretend that its really a Windows application running
on Windows?</p>
<p>It is understandable that there are many outstanding plugins available
as Windows VSTs and, that in many cases, no equivalent is available for
Linux. If a workflow is so dependent on those plugins, Ardour should be
used on Windows (or potentially used with an actual Windows VST host
running inside of Wine). If the effort can be made, a better environment
can be obtained by using a normal build of Ardour and exploring the
world of plugins built to run on Linux natively. This covers LADSPA, LV2
and Linux VST formats, and even some outstanding proprietary plugins
such as those from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.loomer.co.uk/">Loomer</a>.</p>

<h3>A Plea To Plugin Manufacturers<a class="headerlink" href="#a-plea-to-plugin-manufacturers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Please consider porting your plugins so that users can enjoy them on
Linux too. Several other commercial plugin developers have already done
this. You can choose between using “Linux VST” (which is what Loomer and
others have done)—you will find toolkits like JUCE that help to make
this fairly easy—or using LV2 format which is ultimately more flexible
but probably requires more work. We have users—thousands of users—on
Linux who would like to use your plugins.</p>

<h2>70 - Automation<a class="headerlink" href="#automation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Automation is the ability to dynamically control various aspects of a
track’s innate attributes and the attributes of any processors attached
to it. In Ardour, automation can be used to make dynamic changes to a
track’s:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Volume</li>
<li>Panning</li>
<li>Trim</li>
<li>Muting</li>
<li>Any attached processor’s parameters</li>
</ul>
<p>Any combination of these can be enabled on a single track; as such, it
offers a lot of power and flexibility over how a track will ultimately
sound when played back.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="automation-nomenclature">
<h2>70.1 - Automation Nomenclature<a class="headerlink" href="#automation-nomenclature" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Track automation occurs in one or more lanes. Each lane has a control
that allows setting the amount or position of a certain parameter
associated with the lane. Parameters are things that can be controlled
on a track’s automation lane, such as volume, panning, muting, trim,
etc. Automation curves consist of lines connected by control points,
that live within the confines of a lane; these tell Ardour how to change
a given parameter over time. Automation modes govern how a given
automation lane will behave during playback.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="automation-modes">
<h2>70.2 - Automation Modes<a class="headerlink" href="#automation-modes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In order to understand how automation in Ardour works, it is necessary
to understand the four modes of automation. They are: Manual, Play,
Write, and Touch.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id589">
<img alt="The automation mode menu." src="_images/automation-modes1.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The automation mode menu.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Manual mode is basically analogous to a processor’s bypass switch.
Whenever an automation lane is in this mode, it is inactive and any
level that is manually set for controlling the lane’s parameter will
persist during playback like normal.</p>
<p>In Ardour, every track and processor parameter is initially set to
Manual mode.</p>
<p>Play mode tells Ardour to use the automation curve in the automation
lane to control the level of the parameter controlled by the lane
<em>during playback</em>. The control that normally sets the parameter will be
<em>unresponsive to manual input</em> and will move automatically in accord
with the lane’s automation curve during playback.</p>
<p>Write mode allows continuous, dynamic setting of a control during
playback; all such settings are written to the lane the control is in.
This defines the lane’s automation curve in the interval being played,
and overwrites any existing automation curve in the lane being
manipulated.</p>
<p>Touch mode is similar to Write mode, except it only overwrites sections
of a lane’s automation curve when the control is changed in some way.
This allows for changing only the parts of an automation curve that are
desired to be changed, while leaving the rest unchanged.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="automation-lanes">
<h2>70.3 - Automation Lanes<a class="headerlink" href="#automation-lanes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="figure" id="id590">
<img alt="A typical automation lane." src="_images/automation-lane1.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">A typical automation lane.</span></p>
</div>
<p>An automation lane is similar to a track in that it holds data that can
be played back; however, unlike a track, it is not an independent
entity—it is always attached to the track that it controls. Automation
lanes also contain zero to one automation curves. Each lane controls one
and only one parameter of the track it is attached to.</p>
<p>Every track will have at least five automation lanes associated with it:
trim, fader, mute, and pan (which consists of two lanes: L/R and Width);
it can possibly have many more if there are any processors associated
with it. All these lanes are automatically attached to the track but
hidden, and initially they are all empty (have no automation curves in
them).</p>
<p>Automation lanes typically have the following controls:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A hide button (square button with an “X” inside)</li>
<li>A horizontal fader</li>
<li>An automation mode selector</li>
</ul>
<p>The hide button, as the name implies, hides the automation lane. The
horizontal fader controls the level of the parameter that the lane
controls; manipulating this while in Write or Touch mode during playback
will make changes to the lane’s automation curve. The automation mode
selector selects which mode the lane is in (Manual, Play, Write, or
Touch).</p>
<p>The hide button will only hide the lane; it does not remove it from the
track. The automation lane never really goes away—the closest one can
get to that is to clear the automation curve and hide the lane.</p>

</div>
<p>An automation curve is a series of lines connected by control points
that defines a continuous line. As the curve is traversed from left to
right, the line defines the level of the parameter controlled by the
automation lane.</p>
<p>The curve by itself does nothing; it will <em>only</em> control playback if the
lane it is in is in Play mode.</p>

</div>
<p>To automate a parameter on a given track, click on the track’s A button
and select a parameter to control from the menu that appears. Once a
parameter has been selected, an automation lane for that parameter will
appear beneath the track. The lane thus shown will be empty; from here
an automation curve must be defined.</p>
<p>If the height of the automation lane is too small to see all of its
controls, the height can be increased by Left clicking on the bottom
border of the lane and dragging it.</p>
<p>There are three ways to define an automation curve:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Record it using Write mode</li>
<li>Record it using Touch mode</li>
<li>Draw it using the mouse</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="recording-an-automation-curve-using-write-mode">
<h3>Recording an Automation Curve Using Write Mode<a class="headerlink" href="#recording-an-automation-curve-using-write-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To create an automation curve using Write mode, first set the lane’s
mode selector to Write, then set the playhead to the position where the
automation curve should start, then set the transport to play. While the
playhead is moving, Ardour will continuously record any changes made
with the lane’s fader. Even if no changes are made to the fader, they
will overwrite anything that existed in the lane where the playhead is
moving. When the desired automation curve has been recorded, stop the
transport.</p>
<p>After the transport is stopped, the lane’s mode selector will
automatically switch to Touch mode—it is generally a bad idea to leave
an automation lane in Write mode, as it is a destructive operation that
makes it easy to inadvertently overwrite existing automation curves.</p>

<h3>Recording an Automation Curve Using Touch Mode<a class="headerlink" href="#recording-an-automation-curve-using-touch-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Creating an automation curve using Touch mode is similar to the method
employed in creating one using Write mode; the only difference is that
changes are written to the automation curve <em>only</em> when the lane’s fader
is moved—at all other times, whatever was in the automation curve will
remain as it was.</p>
<p>Touch mode is useful when only small parts of the automation curve need
touching up versus Write mode, which is usually used to create the
automation curve in the first place.</p>

Left-clicking in the lane at a point where there is no existing control
point.</p>
<p>Once added, a control point can be Left-clicked and dragged to a desired

move in accord with the curve.</p>

<h2>72 - Video Timeline and Monitoring<a class="headerlink" href="#video-timeline-and-monitoring" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ardour offers a video timeline and video monitoring for convenient audio
mixing and editing to video, in order to produce film soundtracks and
music videos, or perform TV post-production tasks.</p>
<p>The video capabilities are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Import a single video and optionally extract the soundtrack from it.</li>
<li>Provide a video monitor window, or full-screen display, of the
imported video in sync with any of the available Ardour timecode
sources.</li>
<li>Display a frame-by-frame (thumbnail) timeline of the video.</li>
<li>Allow for a configurable timecode offset.</li>
<li><em>Lock</em> audio regions to the video.</li>
<li>Move audio regions with the video at video-frame granularity.</li>
<li>Export the video, trim start and end, add blank frames and/or
multiplex it with the soundtrack of the current session.</li>
</ul>
<p>The setup of the video subsystem is modular and can be configured in
different ways, including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>One machine for all video decoding, video monitoring and audio
editing tasks</li>
<li>Two machines, one for video monitoring, one for Ardour</li>
<li>Three machines, separate video server (for timeline decoding and file
archive), dedicated video monitor, and Ardour</li>

<div class="section" id="single-machine">
<h3>Single Machine<a class="headerlink" href="#single-machine" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If Ardour is compiled from source, or installed from a 3rd party
repository, three additional tools will need to be installed manually,
which are used by Ardour to provide video features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>xjadeo (the video monitor application):
<a class="reference external" href="http://xjadeo.sourceforge.net/">http://xjadeo.sf.net</a></li>
<li>harvid (a video decoder used for the thumbnail timeline):
<a class="reference external" href="http://x42.github.io/harvid/">http://x42.github.com/harvid/</a></li>
<li>ffmpeg, ffprobe (used to import/export video, extract soundtracks and
query video information): <a class="reference external" href="http://ffmpeg.org">http://ffmpeg.org</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Ardour requires xjadeo ≥ version 0.6.4, harvid ≥ version 0.7.0 and
ffmpeg (known to work versions: 1.2, 2.8.2)</p>
<p>The Ardour development team is in control of the first two applications.
ffmpeg however can be a bit of a problem. To avoid conflicts with
distribution packages, Ardour looks for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ffmpeg_harvid</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ffprobe_harvid</span></code>.</p>
<p>All four applications need to be found in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$PATH</span></code> (e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$HOME/bin</span></code>
or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/usr/local/bin</span></code>). For convenience the binary releases of harvid
include ffmpeg_harvid and ffprobe_harvid, but if the distribution
provides suitable ffmpeg commands, symbolic links can be created to the
distribution-provided binaries:</p>
<p>sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ffmpeg /usr/bin/ffmpeg_harvid sudo ln -s
/usr/bin/ffprobe /usr/bin/ffprobe_harvid</p>
<p>Binary releases are available from ardour.org as well as an installer
script:
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Ardour/ardour/blob/master/tools/videotimeline/install_video_tools.sh">install_video_tools.sh</a>.</p>
<p>The easiest way to install the video-utilities is by running the
following line in a terminal:</p>

<h3>Studio Setup<a class="headerlink" href="#studio-setup" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As Setting up a proper A/V post-production studio can be a complicated
task, it is advised to read the info in the previous section to get
familiar with the tools involved first. As much as the Ardour team
streamlines and simplifies the <em>single machine</em> setup, the studio setup
is focused on modularity.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>TODO:</li>
<li>Synchronization ardour → video-display-box should be accomplished by
external means. Jack-transport(netjack), MTC, LTC (OSC and/or
ssh-pipe work but introduce additional latency + jitter)</li>
<li>Ardour launches <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">XJREMOTE</span></code> (environment variable, default
‘xjremote’ which comes with xjadeo).</li>
<li>Either use a custom shell script that ssh’es into the remote box and
launches/controls xjadeo there, selects the sync-source and passes
though communication between ardour ⇔ xjadeo via ssh (xjadeo is
launched stopped with the session).</li>
<li>…or override xjremote’s behavior—instead of IPC with a local running
xjadeo-process, using OSC for example. Xjadeo would run permanently
and Ardour will just tell it to load files and set offsets via OSC.

<li>If the video server runs remotely, Ardour needs to be configured in
Ardour &gt; Preference &gt; Video (hostname of the video-server).</li>
<li>Ideally the machines have a common shared folder (NFS or similar).
Ardour’s import (audio-extract) and export (mux) functionality
depends on having access to the video file. Also Ardour’s
video-import transcodes the file into a suitable proxy-format that
allows reliable seeking to any frame…</li>

<span id="transcoding-formats-amp-codecs"></span><h2>74 - Transcoding, Formats &amp; Codecs<a class="headerlink" href="#transcoding-formats-codecs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This chapter provides a short primer on video files, formats and codecs
– because it is often cause for confusion:</p>
<p>A video file is a container. It usually contains one video track, one or
more audio tracks, and possibly subtitle tracks, chapters… The way these
tracks are stored in the file is defined by the file format. Common
formats are avi, mov, ogg, mkv, mpeg, mpeg-ts, mp4, flv, or vob.</p>
<p>Each of the tracks by itself is encoded using a Codec. Common video
codecs are h264, mpeg2, mpeg4, theora, mjpeg, wmv3. Common audio codecs
are mp2, mp3, dts, aac, wav/pcm.</p>
<p>Not all codecs can be packed into a given format. For example the mpeg
format is limited to mpeg2, mpeg4 and mp3 codecs (not entirely true).
DVDs do have stringent limitations as well. The opposite would be .avi:
pretty much every audio/video codec combination can be contained in an
avi file-format.</p>
<p>To make things worse, naming conventions for video codecs and formats
are often identical (especially MPEG ones) which leads to confusion. All
in all it is a very wide and deep field. Suffice there are different
uses for different codecs and formats.</p>
<div class="section" id="ardour-specific-issues">
<h3>Ardour specific issues<a class="headerlink" href="#ardour-specific-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Ardour supports a wide variety of video file formats codecs. More
specifically, Ardour itself actually does not support any video at all
but delegates handling of video files to
<a class="reference external" href="http://ffmpeg.org/">ffmpeg</a>, which supports over 350 different video
codecs and more than 250 file formats.</p>
<p>When importing a video into Ardour, it will be transcoded (changed from
one format and codec to another) to avi/mjpeg for internal use (this
allows reliable seeking to frames at low CPU cost—the file size will
increase, but hard disks are large and fast).</p>
<p>The export dialog includes presets for common format and codec
combinations (such as DVD, web-video,..). If in doubt, one of the
presets should be used.</p>
<p>As a last note: every time a video is transcoded, the quality can only
get worse. Hence for the final mastering/muxing process, one should
always go back and use the original source of the video.</p>

<p>Adding a video is a two-step process: selecting a video file, and
choosing import mode and optionally selecting an audio track to extract.
Only one video can be present in the session, so opening a video when
one is already opened results in replacing the video.</p>

<p>By default the video is imported using the original width/height. If it

decrease the CPU load and disk I/O required to decode and play the file.</p>
<p>A small, low-quality representation of the image is usually sufficient
for editing soundtracks. The default bitrate in kbit/sec is set to use
0.7 bits per pixel (in comparison, the average DVD medium uses
5000&nbsp;kbit/s; at PAL resolution this is about 0.5 bits per pixel, but the
DVD is using the mpeg2—a denser compression algorithm than the mjpeg
codec used by Ardour).</p>

<p>The video export will take audio from the current Ardour session and
multiplex it with a video file. The soundtrack of the video is taken
from an audio export of Ardour’s master bus.</p>
<p>An arbitrary video file can be chosen. For high quality exports, the
original file (before it was imported into the timeline) should be used.
This is the default behaviour if that file can be found. If not, Ardour
will fall back to the imported proxy-video which is currently in use on
the timeline. Any existing audio tracks on this video file are stripped.</p>
<p>The range selection allows to cut or extend the video. If the session is
longer than the video duration, black frames are prefixed or appended to
the video. (Note: this process may fail with non-standard pixel aspect
ratios). If Ardour’s session range is shorter, the video will be cut
accordingly.</p>
<p>Audio sample-rate and normalization are options for Ardour’s audio
exporter. The remaining settings are options that are directly passed on
to ffmpeg.</p>
<p>The file format is determined by the extension chosen for it (.avi,
.mov, .flv, .ogv, .webm,…). Note: not all combinations of format, codec,
and settings produce files which are according to specifications. For
example, flv files require sample rates of 22.1&nbsp;kHz or 44.1&nbsp;kHz, mpeg
containers can not be used with ac3 audio-codec, etc. If in doubt, one
of the built-in presets should be used.</p>
<p>Ardour video export is not recommended for mastering! While ffmpeg
(which is used by Ardour) can produce high-quality files, this export
lacks the possibility to tweak many settings. We recommend using
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.biggmatt.com/winff/">winff</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.rastersoft.com/programas/devede.html">devede</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="http://dvdauthor.sourceforge.net/">dvdauthor</a> to mux and master.
Nevertheless this video-export comes in handy to do quick snapshots,
intermediates, dailies or online videos.</p>

<p>Ardour sends any feedback to the port and address that sent any feedback
request. The port does not have to match Ardour’s port. In fact it is
better not to. This means that Ardour can deal with more than one
controller at a time. The two controllers can bank independently and
even use different math for faders. This could be used to allow talent

more.</p>
<p>Any time the <em>/set_surface</em> command is sent, the current bank is

feedback and gain mode. using only two parameters will set bank_size and
strip_types. Sending /set_surface with no parameters will result in
Ardour returning a /set_surface message with the current settings.
Surfaces using /set_surface iiii b st fb gm as was the case in versions
of Ardour older than 5.10 will continue to work.</p>
<div class="section" id="bank-size">
<h4>bank_size<a class="headerlink" href="#bank-size" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Bank Size is the number of channel strips the controller supports
without banking. Setting this to 0 turns banking off by setting the bank
size to infinite.</p>
<p>Bank size can also be set with <em>/set_surface/bank_size size.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="strip-types">
<h4>strip_types<a class="headerlink" href="#strip-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>strip_types is an integer made up of bits. The easy way to deal with
this is to think of strip_types items being worth a number and then
adding all those numbers together for a value to send. Strip Types will
determine what kind of strips will be included in bank. This would
include: Audio, MIDI, busses, VCAs, Master, Monitor and hidden or
selected strips.</p>
<p>Aside from setting the track types for the main mix assignments, using
/set_surface/strip_types with more than one surface button will allow
switching between modes for example: inputs only, busses only, selected
only, hidden only, by having the buttons send values of: 3, 12, 256,
512. A full mix button might have a value 31.</p>
<p>While Master and Monitor are listed as possibilities, most surfaces will
not use them. Using /master and /monitor makes more sense. However, in
the case where there are no master or monitor fader strips on the
surface, it may be necessary to include them in the banked strips.</p>
<p>Please see: <a class="reference external" href="#osc58-feedback-and-strip-types-values">Calculating Feedback and Strip-types
Values.</a></p>
<p>Strip types can also be set with <em>/set_surface/strip_types types.</em></p>

<div class="section" id="gainmode">
<h4>gainmode<a class="headerlink" href="#gainmode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Gainmode is a an int that acts as a bool:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>0 (or false)</em> dB value as a float from -193 to +6. Sent as
/strip/gain SSID value. (-193 or below are the same as -inf)</li>
<li><em>1 (or true)</em> A positional fader based on the same math as Ardour’s
GUI. An Float from 0 to 1. Sent as /strip/fader SSID value</li>
</ul>
<p>Gainmode applies only to feedback values. The controller can choose
which gain math to use by choosing to use the /<em>/gain or /</em>/fader path
to send to Ardour. This makes sure a controller that doesn’t set up
Ardour’s OSC can still use either math. The gainmode for feedback also
determines the path Ardour uses for feedback so that the feedback
messages match the control messages.</p>
<p>Gain mode can also be set with <em>/set_surface/gainmode gainmode.</em></p>

plugin is different (as is each parameter), the surface should expect to

<p>As of Ardour 5.9, <em>access_action</em> can be inlined for control surfaces
that are unable to send string parameters. The <em>action_name</em> is composed
of a group and an action in the form of <em>Group/action</em> which fits very

<p>The key_pressed is optional, but if present is a float 1 or 0 where the

<p>Starting with Ardour 5.1 OSC has a graphic setup dialog. This dialog can
be accessed from Preferences-&gt;Control Surfaces. Select OSC and click on
the Show Protocol Settings.</p>
<p>The Ardour OSC dialog has three tabs. The main tab, the Strip Types tab
and the Feedback tab.</p>
<p>Many OSC devices get their IP from a DHCP making it difficult to set an
IP in Ardour’s OSC settings. Therefore, most of the settings are
<em>default</em> settings. Values are set and the next OSC surface to send an
OSC message to Ardour will use those settings. An OSC surface that has
previously sent a message to Ardour will retain the settings it already
had. Any change to a setting will reset all device settings. A
<em>/refresh</em> message will set that device to any new settings. The use of
<em>/set_surface</em> will override all settings except <em>Port Mode</em>. <em>Port
Mode</em> affects all connected surfaces and so all surfaces must use either
the set manual port or send OSC messages from the same port they expect
to receive feedback on.</p>

send from and in fact may change ports they send from as well. Manual
allows the outgoing port, the port the surface will receive on, to be

These set of commands are for smarter control surfaces That have the
logic to figure out what to do with the information. These are not of
value for mapped controllers like touchOSC and friends. The controller
will need to send these queries to Ardour as often as it needs this

<div class="section" id="osc-feedback">
<span id="osc58-feedback"></span><h2>76.4 - OSC: Feedback<a class="headerlink" href="#osc-feedback" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Feedback from the Ardour to the the control surface is very useful for a
number of things. Motor faders need to know where the the track they
have been attached to is at before they were assigned otherwise the DAW
fader will jump to where the controller fader is. Likewise, the buttons
on each strip need to know what their value is so they can light their
LED correctly. Transport controls should let you know if they are active
too. This is what feedback is all about.</p>
<p>Ardour does feedback by sending the same path back that is used to
control the same function. As such any controls that have feedback have
a parameter that is the value of the control or its state (on or off).
In the case of OSC paths listed on the main OSC page as having no
parameter, if they have feedback, they will also work with a 1 for
button press and 0 for button release. This is because many OSC
controllers will only use exactly the same path for feedback as for
control. For example:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="89%" />
<col width="11%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>/transport_stop</td>
<td>&#160;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>can be used also in the form:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>/transport_stop <em>press</em></td>
<td>where <em>press</em> is an int/bool
indicating if the button is
pressed or not.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The feedback does not have the same meaning as the control message.
Where the button release sent to Ardour will be ignored and has no
meaning. Both states have meaning in feedback to the controller. The
feedback will be:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>/transport_stop <em>state</em></td>
<td>where <em>state</em> is an int/bool
indicating if the transport is
stopped or not.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>With feedback turned on, OSC control commands that try to change a
control that does not exist will get feedback that resets that control
to off. For example, sending a /strip/recenable to a buss will not work
and Ardour will try to turn the controller LED off in that case. Also
note that Pan operation may be limited by pan width in some cases. That
is with pan width at 100% (or -100%) there is no pan position movement
available.</p>
<p>It may come as a surprise, but feedback often generates more network
traffic than control itself does. Some things are more obvious like head
position or meters. But even a simple button push like transport start
sends not only a signal to turn on the play LED, but also one to turn
off the stop LED, the Rewind LED, the Fast Forward LED and the Loop LED.
That is still minor, think instead of a surface refresh such as happens
when the surface is first connected and then most of that happens every
time the fader strips are banked. This is why feedback is enabled in
sections so that as little feedback as is actually needed is sent. This
is also a consideration if the surface is connected via wifi.</p>

<span id="id59"></span><h4>Menu actions<a class="headerlink" href="#menu-actions-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Every single menu item in Ardour’s GUI is accessible via OSC. However,
there is no provision for returning the state of anything set this way.
This is not a bad thing as most menu items either do not have an on/off
state or that state is quite visible. Bindings that affect other
parameters that OSC does track will show on those OSC controls. Examples
of this might be track record enable for tracks 1 to 32, play or stop.</p>

<p><em>/set_surface</em> has two values the user needs to calculate before use. In
general these will not be calculated at run time, but beforehand. There
may be more than one button with different values to turn various kinds
of feedback on or off or to determine which kinds of strips are
currently viewed/controlled.</p>
<p>Both <em>feedback</em> and <em>strip-types</em> use bitsets to keep track what they
are doing. Any number in a computer is made out of bits that are on or
off, but we represent them as normal base 10 numbers. Any one bit turned
on will add a unique value to the number as a whole. So for each kind of
feedback or strip type to be used, that number should be added to the
total.</p>
<div class="section" id="strip-types-1">
<span id="id60"></span><h3>strip_types<a class="headerlink" href="#strip-types-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>strip_types is an integer made up of bits. The easy way to deal with
this is to think of strip_types items being worth a number and then
adding all those numbers together for a value to send. Strip Types will
determine What kind of strips will be included in bank. This would
include: Audio, MIDI, busses, VCAs, Master, Monitor and hidden or
selected strips.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>1: AudioTracks.</li>
<li>2: MidiTracks.</li>
<li>4: AudioBusses.</li>
<li>8: MidiBusses.</li>
<li>16: VCAs.</li>
<li>32: Master.</li>
<li>64: Monitor.</li>
<li>128: Audio Aux.</li>
<li>256: Selected.</li>
<li>512: Hidden.</li>
<li>1024: Use Group.</li>
</ul>
<p>Selected and Hidden bits are normally not needed as Ardour defaults to
showing Selected strips and not showing Hidden strips. The purpose of
these two flags is to allow showing only Selected strips or only Hidden
strips. Using Hidden with other flags will allow Hidden strips to show
inline with other strips.</p>
<p>Use Group on will tell ardour that any control on a strip that is part
of a group will affect all strips within that group. Default is off or
the control should only affect the strip the control is applied to. The
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/use_group</span> <span class="pre">f</span> <span class="pre">state</span></code> command can be used to temporarily change this on
the fly.</p>
<p>Some handy numbers to use might be: 15 (all tracks and busses - 1 + 2 +
4 + 8), 31 (add VCAs to that - 15 + 16). Master or Monitor strips are
generally not useful on a surface that has dedicated controls for these
strips as there are /master* and /monitor* commands already. However,
on a surface with just a bank of fader strips, adding master or monitor
would allow access to them within the banks. Selected would be useful
for working on a group or a set of user selected strips. Hidden shows
strips the GUI has hidden.</p>
<p>Audio Aux? say what? I am sure most people will have noticed that they
can find no <em>Aux</em> strips in the Ardour mixer. There are none. There are
busses that can be used a number of ways. From analog days, in OSC, a
bus is something that gets used as a sub mix before ending up going to
Master. An auxiliary bus is used like a separate mixer and its output
goes outside the program or computer to be used as: a monitor mix, a
back up recording, or what have you. In OSC where controller strips may
be limited, it may be useful not to use up a strip for an aux that is
not really a part of the mix. It is also useful to get a list of only
aux busses if the control surface is a phone used to provide talent
monitor mix control on stage. Each performer would be able to mix their
own monitor. The user is free to enable both busses and auxes if they
would prefer.</p>

<h3>feedback<a class="headerlink" href="#id61" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Feedback is an integer made up of bits. The easy way to deal with this
is to think of feedback items being worth a number and then adding all
those numbers together for a value to send.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>1: Button status for strips.</li>
<li>2: Variable control values for strips.</li>
<li>4: Send SSID as path extension.</li>
<li>8: heartbeat to surface.</li>
<li>16: Enable master section feedback.</li>
<li>32: Send Bar and Beat.</li>
<li>64: Send timecode.</li>
<li>128: Send meter as dB (-193 to +6) or 0 to 1 depending on gainmode</li>
<li>256: Send meter a 16 bit value where each bit is a level and all bits
of lower level are on. For use in a LED strip. This will not work if
the above option is turned on.</li>
<li>512: Send signal present, true if level is higher than -40dB</li>
<li>1024: Send position in samples</li>
<li>2048: Send position in time, hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds</li>
<li>8192: Turn on select channel feedback</li>
<li>16384: Use OSC 1.0 /reply instead of #reply</li>
</ul>
<p>So using a value of 19 (1 + 2 + 16) would turn on feedback for strip and
master controls, but leave meters, timecode and bar/beat feedback off.</p>

<h3>Scrub<a class="headerlink" href="#scrub" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Scrub deserves special mention. In an ideal world, scrub would be jog
with sound. However, Ardour does not have that functionality yet. So
scrub starts the transport rolling at either 50% or 100% depending on
how fast the jog wheel is turned. The position of the last tick is
always saved and if no more ticks are received, the transport is located
there when stopped at time out. If the jog wheel gives a value of 0 when
released the transport stops at the location the value 0 is sent.</p>

<span id="osc58-automation"></span><h2>76.7 - OSC: Automation<a class="headerlink" href="#osc-automation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ardour has automation modes for many of its controls. As of version 5.9,
OSC can control what automation mode a fader uses. (<a class="reference external" href="#automation">See
Automation.</a>)</p>
<p>The form of the automation mode command is:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/strip/[control]/automation</span> <span class="pre">ii</span> <span class="pre">ssid</span> <span class="pre">mode</span></code></p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">/strip may also be /select in which case the only parameter is the
mode.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">[control] as of Ardour version 5.9 control can be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>gain</li>
<li>fader</li>
</ul>
<p>This list will expand.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">ssid can be a parameter as shown or inline (automation/[ssid]).
/select has no ssid.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">mode can be one of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">0</span></code> Manual mode</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span></code> Play mode</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2</span></code> Write mode</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">3</span></code> Touch mode</li>
</ul>
<p>The mode value may be sent as a float allowing a “pot” or “slider”
with a range of 0 to 3 to be used to control mode.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The next version of Ardour will add
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/strip/[control]/automation_name</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">ssid</span> <span class="pre">mode_name</span></code> as feedback. A
surface may choose to use only the first character of the string (M, P,
W or T) instead of the whole string (this is in git now).</p>
<p>The touch mode needs more input so there is a Touch command as well
(added post 5.9). It is almost identical to the automation command:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/strip/[control]/touch</span> <span class="pre">ii</span> <span class="pre">ssid</span> <span class="pre">touch</span></code></p>
<p>The only difference is the last parameter is 1 for touched and 0 for
touch released. All of the rest of the explanation above applies.</p>

<div class="section" id="setup">

<p>Some setup needs to be done in the GUI mixer window before this can

<ul class="simple">
<li>Create a bus for each performer who will have personal monitoring. A
good practice is to name the bus with the performers name.</li>
<li>Connect the output of that bus to one of the audio interface’s
playback ports that is not otherwise used. OSC will now include this
bus in its list of aux busses as it no longer has its output
connected to the Master bus.</li>
<li>Add an aux send to each channel the performer needs to hear in their
personal mix. Many performers only need three or four sources to be
mixed. If the performer needs to hear a a set of inputs that are
combined into a bus, adding the aux send to that bus may make more
sense than adding ten drum channels for example.</li>
<li>If the performer wishes to hear effects in their monitor, an extra
send from the send bus, placing the performers aux send after the
effect or a plugin can be added in line in the aux bus itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives stage or studio monitoring for the performer.</p>

<h3>The OSC commands and feedback for personal monitoring<a class="headerlink" href="#the-osc-commands-and-feedback-for-personal-monitoring" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>All of the personal monitoring commands and feedback start with a
<em>/cue</em>. It is expected that a surface used as a personal monitor control
will use only <em>/cue</em> commands.</p>
<p>Most phone OSC applets (TouchOSC, Control) require manual port to be
set. There are certainly more controls than needed. Using send enables
for example, may lead to wasted time discovering why a send has no
sound. A good easy to use controller that fits on most phones while
still being controllable even with big fingers might look like:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Ardour is not limited to talking to one personal monitor controller at a
time, but is able to deal with many simultaneously, each controlling its
own Aux bus.</p>
<p>The send controls and feedback all have the send id (1 to n) in line as
part of the OSC path. So the path for the second send would be
<em>/cue/send/fader/2</em> to set the level. It is considered that most
surfaces used for this will only be able to handle one parameter.</p>

<span id="osc58-parameter-types"></span><h2>76.9 - OSC: Parameter Types<a class="headerlink" href="#osc-parameter-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An OSC message is laid out in this form:</p>
<p>/path/of/command type parameter</p>
<p>The type is there to indicate what the parameter is. This gives the idea
that parameter types are quite strict and if the command requires an
Integer <em>“i”</em> then the controller had better send it. However, the
checking of the parameter type is left to the receiving software.</p>
<p>What this means in practical terms is that the surface can get away with
sending the wrong type of parameter. There are some places where that
just doesn’t make sense. For example, a parameter that is specified as a
Float with a range of 0 to 1, could be sent as an Integer, but would
only have full scale and minimum value with nothing in between. This is
not much use for a fader, though OK for a button.</p>
<p>There are a number of OSC controllers based on iOS and Android tablets
that only send or receive parameters as floats or text. These
controllers should have no problem sending bool or int values as floats.
Ardour will interpret the values as required.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="osc-selection-and-expansion-considerations">
<span id="osc58-selection-and-expansion-considerations"></span><h2>76.10 - OSC: Selection and Expansion Considerations<a class="headerlink" href="#osc-selection-and-expansion-considerations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Ardour does not send every possible feedback value for each channel. It
does send expanded information on the selected channel. There are also
extra commands for the selected strip. All the feedback and select
commands have their own path <em>/select</em>. This means that for the selected
channel the surface does not have to keep track of the strip ID. The
/select strip will follow the “current mixer strip” in the GUI editor
window.</p>
<p>There are two major uses for this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Single strip control surfaces. Using <em>/access_action
Editor/select-next-route</em> or <em>/access_action
Editor/select-prev-route</em> to step through the mixer strips.</li>
<li>Using a “Super strip” section of knobs to control parts of the strip
that are changed less often such as polarity, sends or plugin
parameters.</li>
</ol>
<p>Selection in Ardour’s OSC implementation are complicated by the
possibility of using more than one OSC controller at the same time. User
“A” may select strip 4 and use a selected controller to make changes to
that strip. User “B” may subsequently select strip 7 to make changes on.
This leaves user “A” making changes to strip 7 which they did not
choose.</p>
<p>For this reason Ardour offers local expansion aside from the GUI
selection. Local expansion only affects the one OSC controller. GUI
selection is global and affects all controllers using GUI selection as
well as the GUI.</p>
<p>Both select and expansion use the /select set of commands.</p>
<p>In general, in a one user situation where that one user may use either
the OSC surface or the GUI, using GUI based selection makes the most
sense. This is the default because this is the more common use.</p>
<p>When there is more than one operator, then expansion only is the mode of
choice. It may make sense for one of the surfaces to use GUI selection
where the operator is also using the GUI for some things. However, the
set up should be carefully analyzed for the possibility of selection
confusions. Expansion should be considered the <em>safe</em> option.</p>
<p>It is always OK to use expansion on the surface even in a one user
scenario. This allows the user to use GUI and surface selection for
different uses.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use both if desired. /strip/select will ways set
the GUI select, but /strip/expand will set the select feedback and
commands locally without changing the GUI select. Another /strip/expand
or a /strip/select will override that expand command and releasing the
/strip/expand or /select/expand (setting it to 0 or false) will set the
/select set of commands and feedback back to whichever strip the GUI has
selected at that time. This could be used to switch between the GUI
select and the local expand to compare two strips settings.</p>

<h2>76.11 - OSC control for Ardour 4.7 and Prior<a class="headerlink" href="#osc-control-for-ardour-4-7-and-prior" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This page is what was available before version 5.* was added. It has
not been updated to make sure all 4.7 functionality is accurately
represented. This page will vanish soon.</p>
<p>OSC lets synthesizers and other devices communicate with Ardour. OSC
devices can send commands relating to playback (such as play or stop),
performance (such as volume, play, stop, and almost any other function
(such as Edit, or Undo).</p>
<p>Ardour is probably one of the most OSC-controllable audio applications
around, but as with all OSC-controllable apps, you can’t do much without
knowing what messages can be sent. This document describes the various
categories of messages that Ardour understands. It is subject to change,
particularly the “Actions” part below, since this relates to the GTK GUI
for Ardour rather than the backend.</p>

<h2>77 - Controlling Ardour with Mackie Control Devices<a class="headerlink" href="#controlling-ardour-with-mackie-control-devices" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since Mackie and Logic made the first Logic Control Surface, Mackie and
other surface manufactures have been making control surfaces that use
the same protocol to communicate with a DAW. Ardour supports the MCP and
will work with all these control surfaces.</p>

<h2>77.1 - Devices Using Mackie/Logic Control Protocol<a class="headerlink" href="#devices-using-mackie-logic-control-protocol" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This will walk you through the process of configuring and using a MIDI
control surface with Ardour that uses the Mackie Control protocol (MCP)
or Logic Control protocol. Devices that have been tested and are known
to work include the SSL Nucleus, Mackie Control Pro (plus extenders),
Behringer devices in Mackie/Logic mode, and Steinberg CMC devices.</p>

<h3>Devices using ipMIDI<a class="headerlink" href="#devices-using-ipmidi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you are using a device that uses ipMIDI, such as the SSL Nucleus, no
MIDI port connections are required—Ardour and your control surface will
be able to talk to each other automatically so long as your control
surface and computer are both connected to the same network.</p>

<h3>Connecting control surface and Ardour MIDI ports<a class="headerlink" href="#connecting-control-surface-and-ardour-midi-ports" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Before attempting to use a Mackie Control device that communicates via a
standard MIDI cable or a USB cable, you should ensure that <a class="reference external" href="#midi-on-linux">your Linux
MIDI environment is setup</a>. If you are using a device
that uses normal MIDI (via a standard MIDI or USB cable), you need to
connect Ardour’s Mackie Control in and out ports to the MIDI ports
leading to and coming from the control surface.</p>
<p>When you have made these connections once, Ardour will recreate them for
you in the future, as long as you leave Mackie Control enabled.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="customizing-your-control-surface">
<h3>Customizing your control surface<a class="headerlink" href="#customizing-your-control-surface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Every possible global Mackie Control button can be bound to any

your control surface page for suggestions.</p>

<h3>Preparing your device for use with Ardour<a class="headerlink" href="#preparing-your-device-for-use-with-ardour" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Most interfaces will require some configuration to send and respond to
MCP.</p>
<p>When setting up the control surface, do <em>not</em> use “Pro Tools” mode. Pro
Tools is the only DAW that still requires HUI. The rest of world uses
Mackie Control Protocol. Ardour does not support HUI at this time.</p>

<div class="section" id="ssl-nucleus">
<h2>77.2 - SSL Nucleus<a class="headerlink" href="#ssl-nucleus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Nucleus, from Solid State Logic, is a 16 fader Mackie Control device
that includes many buttons, separate meters, two LCD displays and other
features. The device is not cheap (around US$5000 at the time of
writing), and has some <a class="reference external" href="#design">design features</a> (or lack thereof)
which some Ardour developers find questionable. Nevertheless, it is a
very flexible device, and makes a nice 16 fader surface without the need
to somehow attach an extender to your main surface.</p>
<div class="section" id="pre-configuring-the-nucleus">
<h3>Pre-configuring the Nucleus<a class="headerlink" href="#pre-configuring-the-nucleus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Your Nucleus comes complete with a number of “profiles” for a few
well-known DAWs. At the time of writing it does not include one for
Ardour (or related products such as Harrison Mixbus).</p>
<p>We have prepared a profile in which as many buttons as possible send
Mackie Control messages, which makes the device maximally useful with
Ardour (and Mixbus). You can download <a class="reference external" href="https://community.ardour.org/files/ArdourNucleusProfile.zip">the
profile</a>
and load it to your Nucleus using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Edit</span> <span class="pre">Profiles</span></code> button in SSL’s
Nucleus Remote application. Be sure to select it for the active DAW
layer in order to make Ardour work as well as possible. <em>Note:
unfortunately, the Nucleus Remote application only runs on OS X or
Windows, so Linux users will need access to another system to load the
profile. We will provide notes on the profile settings at a future
time.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="connecting-the-nucleus">
<h3>Connecting the Nucleus<a class="headerlink" href="#connecting-the-nucleus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Unlike most Mackie Control devices, the Nucleus uses an ethernet
connection to send and receive the MIDI messages that make up the Mackie
Control protocol. Specifically, it uses a technology called “ipMIDI”
which essentially “broadcasts” MIDI messages on a local area network, so
that any connected devices (computers, control surfaces, tablets etc.)
can participate.</p>
<p>All other DAWs so far that support the Nucleus have chosen to do so by
using a 3rd party MIDI driver called “ipMIDI”, which creates a number of
“virtual” MIDI ports on your computer. You, the user, tells the DAW
which ports to connect to, and ipMIDI takes care of the rest.</p>
<p>Ardour has builtin ipMIDI support, with no need of any 3rd party
packages, and no need to identify the “ports” to connect to in order to
communicate with the Nucleus. This makes setting it up a bit easier than
most other systems.</p>
<p>Unless … you already installed the ipMIDI driver in order to use some
other DAW with your Nucleus. If ipMIDI is configured to create any
“ports”, it is not possible for Ardour’s own ipMIDI support to function.
We decided to offer both methods of communicating with your Nucleus. If
you regularly use other DAWs, and appreciate having ipMIDI permanently
set up to communication with the Nucleus—that’s OK, you can tell Ardour
to use the ipMIDI driver you already have. But if you’re not using other
DAWs with the Nucleus (and thus have not installed the ipMIDI driver),
then you can ignore the ipMIDI driver entirely, and let Ardour connect
directly with no configuration.</p>
<div class="section" id="connecting-via-ardour-s-own-ipmidi-support">
<h4>Connecting via Ardour’s own ipMIDI support<a class="headerlink" href="#connecting-via-ardour-s-own-ipmidi-support" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This is usable only on computers with no 3rd party ipMIDI driver
software installed and configured. If you have the OS X or Windows
ipMIDI driver from nerds.de, it <strong>MUST</strong> be configured to offer <strong>ZERO</strong>
ports before using this method.</p>
<p>Open <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Preferences</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Control</span> <span class="pre">Surfaces</span></code>. Ensure that the Mackie protocol
is enabled, then double-click on it to open the Mackie Control setup
dialog.</p>
<p>Ensure that the device selected is “SSL Nucleus”. The dialog should show
a single numerical selector control below it, defining the ipMIDI port
number to use (it should almost always be left at the default value of
21928).</p>
<p>Communication is automatically established with the Nucleus and you need
do nothing more.</p>
<p>If this does not work, then make sure your network cables are properly
connected, and that you are <strong>not</strong> running other ipMIDI software on the
computer.</p>

<p>You might be reading this part of the manual seeking some guidance on
whether the Nucleus would make a suitable control surface for your
workflows. We don’t want to try to answer that question definitively,
since the real answer depends on the very specific details of your
workflow and situation, but we would like to point out a number of
design features of the Nucleus that might change your opinion.</p>

</div>
<p>The Behringer BCF-2000 Fader Controller is a control surface with 8
motorized faders, 8 rotary encoders and 30 push buttons. The device is a
class compliant USB Midi Interface and also has standard Midi DIN
IN/OUT/THRU ports. The device has included a Mackie/Logic Control
Emulation Mode since firmware v1.06. Any devices with a firmware older
than v1.06 will require an update before Mackie Control Emulation works
as described here.</p>
<p>In order to put the controller into Mackie/Logic control mode, the unit
must be turned on while holding the third button from the left in the
top most row of buttons (under the rotary encoder row). The button must
be held down until EG or edit global mode is displayed on the LCD screen
of the unit. The global parameters can then be edited using the 8 rotary
encoders in the top row.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Encoder #1 sets the operating mode and should be set to U-1 or USB
mode 1 if using with a USB cable connection.</li>
<li>Encoder #3 sets the foot switch mode and should most likely be set to
Auto to detect how the foot switch is wired.</li>
<li>Encoder #5 sets the device id, if you are using only 1 device the id
should be set to ID 1. If you are using multiple BCF/BCR2000 each
device is required to be set up sequentially and one at a time.</li>
<li>Encoder #7 controls the MIDI Dead Time or the amount of milliseconds
after a move has been made that the device ignores further changes,
this should be set to 100.</li>
<li>Encoder #8 controls the MIDI message Send Interval in milliseconds
and should be set to 10</li>

Control and the Mackie Control Pro and so on, all use this same
protocol. Any units from other manufactures will also use the same

<h2>77.5 - Working With Extenders<a class="headerlink" href="#working-with-extenders" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are currently 5 devices pre-configured to work with extenders. Two
of them are for one master and one extender with the master on the right
side or master on the left side. There are three presets for a master
and two extenders with the master on the left, in the center and on the
right. While these files will work for many uses there may be cases
where a custom device profile makes more sense. The best way is to start
with the *.device file in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Ardour/ardour/tree/master/mcp">Source
Tree</a> that matches
your master device and copy it to a new name such as xt+mc.device in the
<a class="reference external" href="#files-and-directories-ardour-knows-about">user config</a> sub
directory <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mcp</span></code> and then edit that file. It is best to name the file
with the order the devices are expected to be used in as the position of
the master device is specified in this file.</p>
<p>The three lines of interest are:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Name</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;Device name&quot;</span><span class="o">/&gt;</span>

</pre></div>

<p>Add any lines that are not present.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Name</span></code> value should be a unique name so it is obvious in the list
of devices (so change it).</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Extenders</span></code> value is the number of extenders used and should not
include the master in that number.</p>
<p>When an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Extenders</span></code> value of greater than 0 is used, extra midi ports
will appear for the extenders to be connected to. The MIDI ports for the
controllers will be named <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mackie</span> <span class="pre">control</span> <span class="pre">in/out</span></code> for the master,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mackie</span> <span class="pre">control</span> <span class="pre">in/out</span> <span class="pre">ext</span> <span class="pre">#*</span></code> where * is the position of the
extender from left to right. So for a master in the middle with an
extender on either side, the ports from left to right will be mackie
control in/out ext #1, mackie control in/out and mackie control in/out
ext #3.</p>
<p>If using the MCP GUI to connect surfaces the top surface is the leftmost

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The Mackie Control Device Dialog</span></p>
</div>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MasterPosition</span></code> value is the position the master unit (with the
master fader) is located at within the group of surfaces. The surfaces
are numbered from 1 at the left side and up. So if there are three
surfaces, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;MasterPosition</span> <span class="pre">value=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;</span></code> will expect the master on the

<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;MasterPosition</span> <span class="pre">value=&quot;3&quot;/&gt;</span></code> would be master on the right.</p>
<p>The default value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;MasterPosition</span> <span class="pre">value=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;</span></code> has the same effect

<h2>78 - Generic MIDI<a class="headerlink" href="#generic-midi" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Generic Midi allows synthesizers and other devices communicate with

play or stop), performance (such as volume, play, stop, and almost any
other function (such as Edit, or Undo).</p>

with the ability to load a MIDI binding map for a given controller,

<h3>Creating new MIDI maps<a class="headerlink" href="#creating-new-midi-maps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="section" id="the-basic-concept">
<h4>The Basic Concept<a class="headerlink" href="#the-basic-concept" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Since the beginning of time (well, sometime early in the 2.X series),
Ardour has had the concept of identifying each track and bus with a
remote control ID. This ID uniquely identifies a track or bus so that
when messages arrive from elsewhere via MIDI or OSC , we can determine
which track or bus they are intended to control. See <a class="reference external" href="#controlling-track-ordering">remote control
IDs</a> for more information. You just need
to know that there is a “first track” and its remote control ID is 1,
and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="getting-started">
<h4>Getting Started<a class="headerlink" href="#getting-started" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>MIDI bindings are stored in files with the suffix “.map” attached to
their name. The minimal content looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;ArdourMIDIBindings version=&quot;1.0.0&quot; name=&quot;The name of this set of
bindings&quot;&gt;
&lt;/ArdourMIDIBindings&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So, to start, create a file with that as the initial contents.</p>
<p>The file should be located in the midi_maps sub directory located in the
<a class="reference external" href="#files-and-directories-ardour-knows-about">Ardour configuration
directory</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="finding-out-what-your-midi-control-surface-sends">
<h4>Finding out what your MIDI control surface sends<a class="headerlink" href="#finding-out-what-your-midi-control-surface-sends" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This is the most complex part of the job, but its still not very hard.
You need to connect the control surface to an application that will show
you the information that the device sends each time you modify a knob,
slider, button etc. There are a variety of such applications (notably
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">gmidimon</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kmidimon</span></code>, but you can actually use Ardour for this
if you want. Start Ardour in a terminal window, connect MIDI ports up,
and in the Preferences window, enable “Trace Input” on the relevant MIDI
port. A full trace of the MIDI data received will show up in the
terminal window. (Note: in Ardour3, you get a dedicated, custom dialog
for this kind of tracing.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="types-of-bindings">
<h4>Types of Bindings<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-bindings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>There are two basic kinds of bindings you can make between a MIDI
message and something inside Ardour. The first is a binding to a
specific parameter of a track or bus. The second is a binding to a
function that will change Ardour’s state in some way.</p>
<div class="section" id="binding-to-track-bus-controls">
<h5>Binding to Track/Bus controls<a class="headerlink" href="#binding-to-track-bus-controls" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>A track/bus binding has one of two basic structures</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;Binding</span> <span class="pre">msg</span> <span class="pre">specification</span>&#160; <span class="pre">uri=&quot;…</span> <span class="pre">control</span> <span class="pre">address</span> <span class="pre">…&quot;/&gt;</span>&#160;&#160; <span class="pre">&lt;Binding</span> <span class="pre">msg</span> <span class="pre">specification</span>&#160; <span class="pre">function=&quot;…</span> <span class="pre">function</span> <span class="pre">name</span> <span class="pre">…&quot;/&gt;</span></code></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="message-specifications">
<h5>Message specifications<a class="headerlink" href="#message-specifications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>You can create a binding for either 3 types of channel messages, or for
a system exclusive (“sysex”) message. A channel message specification
looks like this:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;Binding</span> <span class="pre">channel=&quot;1&quot;</span> <span class="pre">ctl=&quot;13&quot;</span> <span class="pre">…</span></code></p>
<p>This defines a binding for a MIDI Continuous Controller message
involving controller 13, arriving on channel 1. There are 16 MIDI
channels, numbered 1 to 16. Where the example above says <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ctl</span></code>, you
can alternatively use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">note</span></code> (to create binding for a Note On message)
or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pgm</span></code> (to create a binding for a Program Change message).</p>
<p>As of Ardour 4.2, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">enc-r</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">enc-l</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">enc-2</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">enc-b</span></code> may be
used for surfaces that have encoders that send offsets rather than
values. These accept Continuous Controller messages but treat them as
offsets. These are good for banked controls as they are always at the
right spot to start adjusting. ( <a class="reference external" href="#generic-midi-and-encoders">Learn more about working with
encoders</a>)</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;Binding</span> <span class="pre">channel=&quot;1&quot;</span> <span class="pre">enc-r=&quot;13&quot;</span> <span class="pre">…</span></code></li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;Binding</span> <span class="pre">channel=&quot;1&quot;</span> <span class="pre">enc-l=&quot;13&quot;</span> <span class="pre">…</span></code></li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;Binding</span> <span class="pre">channel=&quot;1&quot;</span> <span class="pre">enc-2=&quot;13&quot;</span> <span class="pre">…</span></code></li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;Binding</span> <span class="pre">channel=&quot;1&quot;</span> <span class="pre">enc-b=&quot;13&quot;</span> <span class="pre">…</span></code></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">enc-*</span></code> value is the CC number used by the encoder. Encoders only
work with CC messages.</p>
<p>Ardour 5.12 has a bug with the encoder detection where the first encoder
message resets the control to 0. Setting “Enable Feedback” on allows
encoders to work as expected.</p>
<p>You can also bind sysex messages:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;Binding</span> <span class="pre">sysex=&quot;f0</span> <span class="pre">0</span> <span class="pre">0</span> <span class="pre">e</span> <span class="pre">9</span> <span class="pre">0</span> <span class="pre">5b</span> <span class="pre">f7&quot;</span> <span class="pre">….</span>&#160;&#160; <span class="pre">&lt;Binding</span> <span class="pre">sysex=&quot;f0</span> <span class="pre">7f</span> <span class="pre">0</span> <span class="pre">6</span> <span class="pre">7</span> <span class="pre">f7&quot;</span> <span class="pre">….</span></code></p>
<p>The string after the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sysex=</span></code> part is the sequence of MIDI bytes, as
hexadecimal values, that make up the sysex message.</p>
<p>Finally, you can bind a totally arbitrary MIDI message:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;Binding</span> <span class="pre">msg=&quot;f0</span> <span class="pre">0</span> <span class="pre">0</span> <span class="pre">e</span> <span class="pre">9</span> <span class="pre">0</span> <span class="pre">5b</span> <span class="pre">f7&quot;</span> <span class="pre">….</span>&#160;&#160; <span class="pre">&lt;Binding</span> <span class="pre">msg=&quot;80</span> <span class="pre">60</span> <span class="pre">40&quot;</span> <span class="pre">….</span></code></p>
<p>The string after the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">msg=</span></code> part is the sequence of MIDI bytes, as
hexadecimal values, that make up the message you want to bind. Using
this is slightly less efficient than the other variants shown above, but
is useful for some oddly designed control devices.</p>
<p>As of Ardour 4.6 it is possible to use multi-event MIDI strings such as
two event CC messages, RPN or NRPN.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sysex=</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">msg=</span></code> bindings will only work with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">function=</span></code>
or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">action=</span></code> control addresses. They will <em>not</em> work with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">uri=</span></code>
control addresses. Controls used with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">uri=</span></code> require a <em>Value</em> which
is only available in a known place with channel mode MIDI events.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="control-address">
<h5>Control address<a class="headerlink" href="#control-address" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>A control address defines what the binding will actually control. There
are quite a few different things that can be specified here:</p>
<p>Enable Feeback applies to these “Control Addresses” only.</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>/route/gain</td>
<td>the gain control (“fader”) for
the track/bus</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>/route/trim</td>
<td>the trim control for the
track/bus (new in 4.1)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>/route/solo</td>
<td>a toggleable control for solo
(and listen) of the track/bus</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>/route/mute</td>
<td>a toggleable control to
mute/unmute the track/bus</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>/route/recenable</td>
<td>a toggleable control to
record-enable the track</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>/route/panwidth</td>
<td>interpreted by the track/bus
panner, should control image
“width”</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>/route/pandirection</td>
<td>interpreted by the track/bus
panner, should control image
“direction”</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>/route/plugin/parameter</td>
<td>the Mth parameter of the Nth
plugin of a track/bus</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>/route/send/gain</td>
<td>the gain control (“fader”) of the
Nth send of a track/bus</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each of the specifications needs an address, which takes various forms
too. For track-level controls (solo/gain/mute/recenable), the address is
one the following:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />
</colgroup>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-odd"><td>a number, e.g. “1”</td>
<td>identifies a track or bus by its
remote control ID</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>B, followed by a number</td>
<td>identifies a track or bus by its
remote control ID within the
current bank (see below for more
on banks)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>S, followed by a number</td>
<td>identifies a selected track in
order they have been selected, S1
should be the same track as the
Editor Mixer</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>one or more words</td>
<td>identifies a track or bus by its
name</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For send/insert/plugin controls, the address consists of a track/bus
address (as just described) followed by a number identifying the
plugin/send (starting from 1). For plugin parameters, there is an
additional third component: a number identifying the plugin parameter
number (starting from 1).</p>
<p>One additional feature: for solo and mute bindings, you can also add
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">momentary=&quot;yes&quot;</span></code> after the control address. This is useful primarily
for NoteOn bindings—when Ardour gets the NoteOn it will solo or mute the
targetted track or bus, but then when a NoteOff arrives, it will un-solo
or un-mute it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bindings-to-ardour-functions">
<h5>Bindings to Ardour “functions”<a class="headerlink" href="#bindings-to-ardour-functions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>There is currently no feedback available for functions.</p>
<p>Rather than binding to a specific track/bus control, it may be useful to
have a MIDI controller able to alter some part of Ardour’s state. A
binding definition that does this looks like this:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;Binding</span> <span class="pre">channel=&quot;1&quot;</span> <span class="pre">note=&quot;13&quot;</span> <span class="pre">function=&quot;transport-roll&quot;/&gt;</span></code></p>
<p>In this case, a NoteOn message for note number 13 (on channel 1) will
start the transport rolling. The following function names are available:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="50%" />
<col width="50%" />

<h5>Binding to Ardour “actions”<a class="headerlink" href="#binding-to-ardour-actions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>It is not possible to have feedback available for actions because these
represent keyboard shortcuts which are input only.</p>
<p>You can also bind a sysex or arbitrary message to any of the items that
occur in Ardour’s main menu (and its submenus). The <a class="reference external" href="#list-of-menu-actions">list of
actions</a> shows all available values of
<em>action-name</em>.</p>
<p>To create a binding between an arbitrary MIDI message (we’ll use a
note-off on channel 1 of MIDI note 60 (hex) with release velocity 40
(hex)), the binding file would contain:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;Binding</span> <span class="pre">msg=&quot;80</span> <span class="pre">60</span> <span class="pre">40&quot;</span> <span class="pre">action=&quot;Editor/temporal-zoom-in&quot;/&gt;</span></code></p>
<p>The general rule, when taken an item from the keybindings file and using
it in a MIDI binding is to simply strip the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;Action&gt;</span></code> prefix of the
second field in the keybinding definition.</p>

<h4>Banks and Banking<a class="headerlink" href="#banks-and-banking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Because many modern control surfaces offer per-track/bus controls for
far fewer tracks &amp; busses than many users want to control, Ardour
offers the relatively common place concept of banks. Banks allow you
to control any number of tracks and/or busses easily, regardless of
how many faders/knobs etc. your control surface has.</div>
<div class="line">To use banking, the control addresses must be specified using the bank
relative format mentioned above (“B1” to identify the first track of a
bank of tracks, rather than “1” to identify the first track).</div>
</div>
<p>One very important extra piece of information is required to use
banking: an extra line near the start of the list of bindings that
specifies how many tracks/busses to use per bank. If the device has 8
faders, then 8 would be a sensible value to use for this. The line looks
like this:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;DeviceInfo</span> <span class="pre">bank-size=&quot;8&quot;/&gt;</span></code></p>
<p>In addition, you probably want to ensure that you bind something on the
control surface to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">next-bank</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">prev-bank</span></code> functions,
otherwise you and other users will have to use the mouse and the GUI to
change banks, which rather defeats the purpose of the bindings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-selected-strip">
<h4>The Selected Strip<a class="headerlink" href="#the-selected-strip" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

the selected strip can be designated with <em>S1</em>.</p>

<p>There are no “best” ways to map an arbitrary MIDI controller for
controlling Ardour. There may be very legitimate reasons for different
users to prefer quite different mappings.</p>
<p>On every platform that Ardour runs on, there are excellent
free-of-charge tools for making connections between MIDI hardware and
“virtual” MIDI ports like the ones that Ardour creates and uses. Rather
than waste precious developer time replicating these connection/patch
managers, we prefer to leverage their existence by having users rely on
them to actually connect Ardour to other MIDI devices and software. On
OS X, we recommend Pete Yandell’s MIDI Patchbay. On Linux, a wide
variety of tools are available including QJackCtl, aconnect, Patchage,
and more.</p>

<p>Encoders are showing up more frequently on controllers. However, they
use the same MIDI events as Continuous Controllers and they have no
standard way of sending that information as MIDI events. Ardour 4.2 has
implemented 4 of the more common ways of sending encoder information.</p>
<p>Encoders that send the same continuous values as a pot would are not
discussed here as they are already supported by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ctl</span></code>.</p>
<p>Encoders as this page talks about them send direction and offset that
the DAW will add to or subtract from the current value.</p>
<p>The 4 kinds of encoder supported are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>enc-r: On the bcr/bcf2000 this is called “Relative Signed Bit”. The
most significant bit sets positive and the lower 6 significant bits
are the offset.</li>
<li>enc-l: The bcr2000 calls this “Relative Signed Bit 2”. The most
significant bit sets negative and the lower 6 significant bits are
the offset. If you are using one of these two and the values are
right but reversed, use the other. This one is the one the Mackie
Control Protocol uses.</li>
<li>enc-2: The bcr2000 calls this one “Relative 2s Complement”. Positive
offsets are sent as normal from 1 to 64 and negative offsets are sent
as 2s complement negative numbers.</li>
<li>enc-b: The bcr2000 calls this one “Relative Binary Offset”. Positive
offsets are sent as offset plus 64 and negative offsets are sent as
64 minus offset.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the wrong one is chosen, either the positive or negative side will
act incorrectly. It is not really possible to auto detect which one the
controller is using. Trial and error is the only way if the
specification of the controller is not known.</p>
<p>Many controllers have more than one choice as well, check the manual for
the surface.</p>

<h2>79 - Using the PreSonus FaderPort<a class="headerlink" href="#using-the-presonus-faderport" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since version 4.5, Ardour has had full support for the Presonus
Faderport. This is a compact control surface featuring a single
motorized fader, a single knob (encoder) and 24 buttons with fixed
labels. It is a relatively low-cost device that functions very well to
control a single (selected) track or bus, along with a variety of other
“global” settings and conditions.</p>
<div class="section" id="connecting-the-faderport">
<h3>Connecting the Faderport<a class="headerlink" href="#connecting-the-faderport" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Faderport comes with a single USB socket on the back. Connect a
suitable USB cable from there to a USB port on your computer. As of the
end of 2015, you should avoid USB3 ports—these cause erratic behaviour
with the device. This issue might get fixed by Presonus in the future.</p>
<p>Ardour uses the Faderport in what Presonus calls “native” mode. You do
not need to do anything to enable this—Ardour will set the device to be
in the correct mode. In native mode, the Faderport sends and receives
ordinary MIDI messages to/from the host, and the host understands the
intended meaning of these messages. We note this detail to avoid
speculation about whether Ardour supports the device via the HUI
protocol—it does not.</p>
<p>The Faderport will be automatically recognized by your operating system,
and will appear in any of the lists of possible MIDI ports in both
Ardour and other similar software.</p>
<p>To connect the Faderport to Ardour, open the Preferences dialog, and
then click on “Control Surfaces”. Click on the “Enable” button in the
line that says “Faderport” in order to activate Ardour’s Faderport
support. Then double click on the line that says “Faderport”. A new
dialog will open, containing (among other things) two dropdown selectors
that will allow you to identify the MIDI ports where your Faderport is
connected.</p>
<div class="figure" id="id618">
<img alt="The Faderport configuration dialog" src="_images/faderport_dialog.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The Faderport configuration dialog</span></p>
</div>
<p>Once you select the input and output port, Ardour will initialize the
Faderport and it will be ready to use. You only need do this once: once
these ports are connected and your session has been saved, the
connections will be made automatically in this and other future
sessions.</p>
<p>You do not need to use the power supply that comes with the Faderport
but without it, the fader will not be motorized. This makes the overall
experience of using the Faderport much less satisfactory, since the
fader will not move when Ardour tells it to, leading to very out-of-sync
conditions between the physical fader position and the “fader position”
inside the program.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-the-faderport">
<h3>Using the Faderport<a class="headerlink" href="#using-the-faderport" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Faderport’s controls can be divided into three groups:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Global controls such as the transport buttons</li>
<li>Controls which change the settings for particular track or bus</li>
<li>Controls which alter which track or bus is modified by the
per-track/bus controls.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because the Faderport has only a single set of per-track controls, by
default those controls operate on the first selected track or bus. If
there is no selected track or bus, the controls will do nothing.</p>

<h4>Other Global Controls<a class="headerlink" href="#other-global-controls" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Mix, Proj, Trns buttons do not obviously correspond any particular
functions or operations in Ardour. We have therefore allowed users to
choose from a carefully curated set of possible actions that seem
related to the button labels in some clear way. This can be done via the
Faderport configuration dialog accessed via
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Preferences</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">Control</span> <span class="pre">Surfaces</span></code>. Each button has 3 possible actions
associated with it:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Plain Press: action to be taken when the button is pressed on its
own.</li>
<li>Shift-Press: action to be taken when the button is pressed in
conjunction with the Shift button.</li>
<li>Long Press: action to be taken when the button is pressed on its own
and held down for more than 0.5 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Click on the relevant drop-down selector to pick an action as you
prefer.</p>
<p>The User button also has no obvious mapping to specific Ardour
functionality, so we allow users to choose from <em>any</em> possible GUI
action. The menu for selecting the action is somewhat confusing and it
can be hard to find what you’re looking for. However, all possible
actions are there, so keep looking!</p>

8</a>.</p>
<p>The FaderPort™ 8 is a production control surface with 8 touch-sensitive,

<p>The FaderPort 8 (FP8) comes with a USB socket on the back. Connect a
suitable USB cable from there to a USB port on your computer. The FP8
will be automatically recognized by your operating system, and will
appear in any of the lists of possible MIDI ports in both Ardour and
other similar software.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Ardour uses the FaderPort 8 in what PreSonus calls “Studio One” or
“native” mode. To use the FaderPort8 with Ardour’s FP8 Control
Surface, make sure that the device is in “Studio One” mode. (If you
would like to change the mode at any point, power on the unit while
holding down the two leftmost Select buttons, see the FaderPort 8
manual for further details. Also note that at least firmware version
1.01 is required. NB. “factory default” resets the firmware, see the
PreSonus FaderPort8 Owner’s manual chapter 9.4.)</div>
<div class="line">While the FaderPort provides a Mackie Control Universal (MCU) mode,
which works with Ardour’s Mackie Control Surface, MCU does not support
various elements available on the FP8 (e.g. colored buttons, and the
custom mode scribble strips).</div>
</div>
<p>To connect the FP8 to Ardour, open the Preferences dialog, select
“Control Surfaces” and enable “PreSonus FaderPort 8”. Then open the
“Protocol Settings” dialog for the FP8. Which (among other things)
allows to select the the MIDI ports corresponding to the FP8.</p>
<p>Once you select the input and output port, Ardour will initialize the
FP8 and it will be ready to use. You only need do this once: Once these
ports are connected and your session has been saved, the connections
will be made automatically in this and other future sessions.</p>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Track: In Track-mode, the motorized faders display and control a
mixer-strip’s signal level. The Pan/Param encoder modifies the
azimuth of the panner (hold Shift to control the width, if the
track’s panner supports it). Mute and Solo affect the respective
mixer-strip.</li>
<li>Edit Plugins: When Edit Plug-ins mode is active, the motorized faders
will control the parameter settings of a given plugin-insert.
Press the Edit Plugins button to view all available plugin-inserts on
a strip. If no plugins are available, Edit Plugins will not engage
and the FP8 automatically switches back to Track-mode.
<strong>Select Plugin Mode</strong>: Use the Select buttons under the scribble
strip to pick a plugin to edit.
The Select button color indicates the bypass/enable state of the
plugin (red: bypassed, green: enabled). Use Shift + Select to toggle
the bypass state.
Selecting a plugin enters <strong>Parameter Edit Mode</strong>: The faders and the
Select buttons will respectively control the parameters and toggle
controls of the selected plugin (once a plugin has been selected, it
stays in edit mode regardless of track selection). If there are more
than eight parameters, the Pan/Param encoder allows to scroll through
available control-parameters (hold Shift to bank by 8).
If the plugin has any presets, pressing the Pan/Param encoder
switches to the <strong>plugin-preset display</strong>: Plugin preset names are
displayed on the scribble-displays, the Select button below each
loads the preset. The “Pan/Param” encoder can be used to scroll
through presets if there are more than seven (right-most, 8th, slot
is reserved to unload/clear a loaded preset, hold Shift to bank by
7). The Select button color is used to indicate the currently loaded
preset (if any) and blinks if a parameter has been modified since
loading the preset. Loading a preset or pressing the Pan/Param
encoder again switches back to the Plugin Parameter Edit Mode.
In Parameter Edit Mode, the “Open” (Shift + Macro) allows to toggle
the Plugin GUI visibility.
Press the Edit Plugins button again to return to the Select Plugin
Mode.</li>
<li>Sends: In Sends mode, each of the faders is mapped to the send-level
of aux-sends of the selected track. If there are more than eight
sends on a given track, the Pan/Param encoder can scroll through
them. Send-mode follow the selection. If there are no sends on a
given track, the FP8 automatically switches back to Track-mode.</li>
<li>Pan: When Pan mode is active, the motorized faders will display and
control the panner’s azimuth. The Pan/Param controls the pan-width of
the selected mixer-strip.</li>
</ol>
<p>Shift + Track toggles timecode display on/off (middle row of the

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">The Ableton Push 2 surface</span></p>
</div>
<p>Since version 5.4, Ardour has had extensive support for the Ableton
Push2. This is an expensive but beautifully engineered control surface
primarily targeting the workflow found in Ableton’s Live software and
other similar tools such as Bitwig. As of version 5.4, Ardour does not
offer the same kind of workflow, so we have designed our support for the
Push 2 around mixing and editing and musical performance, without the
clip/scene oriented approach in Live. This may change in future versions
of Ardour.</p>
<div class="section" id="connecting-the-push-2">
<h3>Connecting the Push 2<a class="headerlink" href="#connecting-the-push-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Plug the USB cable from the Push 2 into a USB2 or USB3 port on your
computer. For brighter backlighting, also plug in the power supply (this
is not necessary for use).</p>
<p>The Push 2 will be automatically recognized by your operating system,
and will appear in any of the lists of possible MIDI ports in both
Ardour and other similar software.</p>
<p>To connect the Push 2 to Ardour, open the Preferences dialog, and then
click on “Control Surfaces”. Click on the “Enable” button in the line
that says “Ableton Push 2” in order to activate Ardour’s Push 2 support.</p>
<p>Once you select the input and output port, Ardour will initialize the
Push 2 and it will be ready to use. You only need do this once: once
these ports are connected and your session has been saved, the
connections will be made automatically in this and other future
sessions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="push-2-configuration">
<h3>Push 2 Configuration<a class="headerlink" href="#push-2-configuration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The only configuration option at this time is whether the pads send
aftertouch or polyphonic pressure messages. You can alter this setting
via the Push 2 GUI, accessed by double-clicking on the “Push 2” entry in
the control surfaces list.</p>

<h3>Musical Performance<a class="headerlink" href="#musical-performance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Messages sent from the 8x8 pad grid and the “pitch bend bar” are routed
to a special MIDI port within Ardour called “Push 2 Pads” (no extra
latency is incurred from this routing). Although you can manually
connect this port to whatever you wish, the normal behaviour of Ardour’s
Push 2 support is to connect the pads to the most recently selected MIDI
track.</p>
<p>This means that to play a soft-synth/instrument plugin in a given MIDI
track with the Push 2, you just need to select that track.</p>
<p>If multiple MIDI tracks are selected at once, the first selected track
will be used. Note that messages originating from all other controls on
the Push 2 will <em>not</em> not be delivered to the “Push 2 Pads” port. This
makes no difference in practice, because the other controls do not send
messages that are useful for musical performance.</p>

<div class="section" id="global-mix">
<h3>Global Mix<a class="headerlink" href="#global-mix" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is the default mode that Ardour will start the Push 2 in. In this

it in the Push 2 display. The
physical knob will alter
track/bus gain.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Pans</td>
<td>The display shows a knob
indicating the pan

panners have “width” parameter
that defaults to 100%. You cannot
change the pan direction/azimuth
of a track with 100% width, but
must first reduce the width in
order to pan it. Similarly, a
track panned anywhere other than
dead center has limits on the
maximum width setting. If these
concepts are not familiar to you,

use a “panner” that actually
implement “balance” and not
“panning”, hence the difference.</p>

<h3>Track Mix<a class="headerlink" href="#track-mix" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Track Mix mode allows you to focus on a single track in more detail than
is possible in Global Mix mode. To enter (or leave) Track Mix mode,
press the “Mix” button.</p>
<p>In Track Mix mode, various aspects of the state of the first selected
track/bus will be displayed on the Push 2. Above the display, the first
4 knobs control track volume (gain), pan directiom/azimuth, pan width,
and where appropriate, track input trim.</p>
<p>Below the display, 7 buttons provide immediate control of mute, solo,
rec-enable, monitoring (input or disk or automatic), solo isolate and
solo safe state. When a a track is muted due to other track(s) soloing,
the mute button will flash (to differentiate from its state when it is
explicitly muted).</p>
<p>The video display also shows meters for the track, which as in Global
Mix mode, precisely match the meter type shown in Ardour’s GUI. There
are also two time displays showing the current playhead position in both
musical (beats|bars|ticks) format, and as hours:minutes:seconds.</p>

using the cursor/arrow keys to the lower right of the display, or the
knobs above the display. The scale will change dynamically as you
scroll. You can also scroll in whole pages using the upper right and
upper left buttons above the display (they will display “&lt;” and “&gt;” if
scrolling is possible).</p>
<p>To change the root note of the scale, press the corresponding button
above or below the video display.The button will be lit to indicate your
selection (and the text will be highlighted).</p>
<p>By default, Ardour configures the Push 2 pads to use “in-key” mode,
where all pads correspond to notes “in” the chosen scale. Notes
corresponding to the root note, or the equivalent note in higher
octaves, are highlighted with the color of the current target MIDI
track.</p>
<p>In “chromatic” mode, the pads correspond to a continuous sequence of
notes starting with your selected root note. Pads corresponding to notes
in the scale are illuminated; those corresponding to the root note are
lit with the color the current target MIDI track. Other pads are left
dark, but you can still play them.</p>
<p>To switch between them, press button on the lower left of the video
display; the text above it will display the current mode (though it is

<h2>82 - Lua Scripting<a class="headerlink" href="#lua-scripting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Starting with version 4.7.213, Ardour supports Lua scripts.</p>
<p>This Documentation is Work in Progress and far from complete. Also the
documented API may be subject to change.</p>
<div class="section" id="preface">
<span id="id72"></span><h3>Preface<a class="headerlink" href="#preface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are cases that Ardour cannot reasonably cater to with core
functionality alone, either because they’re session specific or user
specific edge cases.</p>
<p>Examples for these include voice-activate (record-arm specific tracks
and roll transport depending on signal levels), rename all regions after
a specific timecode, launch an external application when a certain track
is soloed, generate automation curves or simply provide a quick shortcut
for a custom batch operation.</p>
<p>Cases like this call for means to extend the DAW without actually
changing the DAW itself. This is where scripting comes in.</p>
<p>“Scripting” refers to tasks that could alternatively be executed
step-by-step by a human operator.</p>
<p>Lua is a tiny and simple language which is easy to learn, yet allows for
comprehensive solutions. Lua is also a glue language it allows to tie
existing component in Ardour together in unprecedented ways, and most
importantly Lua is one of the few scripting-languages which can be
safely used in a real-time environment.</p>
<p>A good introduction to Lua is the book <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lua.org/pil/">Programming in
Lua</a>. The first edition is available online,
but if you have the means buy a copy of the book, it not only helps to
support the Lua project, but provides for a much nicer reading and
learning experience.</p>

<div class="section" id="id73">
<span id="id74"></span><h3>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#id73" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The core of Ardour is a real-time audio engine that runs and processes
audio. One interfaces with an engine by sending it commands. Scripting
can be used to interact with or modify the active Ardour session, just
like a user uses the Editor/Mixer GUI to modify the state or parameters
of the session.</p>
<p>Doing this programmatically requires some knowledge about the objects
used internally. Most Ardour C++ objects and their methods are directly
exposed to Lua and one can call functions or modify variables:</p>
<div style="width:80%; margin:.5em auto;"><div style="width:45%; float:left;"><p>C++
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">session-&gt;set_transport_speed</span> <span class="pre">(1.0);</span></code></p>
</div><div style="width:45%; float:right;"><p>Lua
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Session:set_transport_speed</span> <span class="pre">(1.0)</span></code></p>
</div></div><div style="clear:both;"></div><p>You may notice that there is only a small syntactic difference in this
case. While C++ requires recompiling the application for every change,
Lua script can be loaded, written or modified while the application is
running. Lua also abstracts away many of the C++ complexities such as
object lifetime, type conversion and null-pointer checks.</p>
<p>Close ties with the underlying C++ components is where the power of
scripting comes from. A script can orchestrate interaction of
lower-level components which take the bulk of the CPU time of the final
program.</p>
<p>At the time of writing Ardour integrates Lua 5.3.2: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html">Lua 5.3 reference
manual</a>.</p>

<p>Like Control surfaces and the GUI, Lua Scripts are confined to certain
aspects of the program. Ardour provides the framework and runs Lua (not
the other way around).</p>

called whenever the action is triggered. A simple action script is shown
above.</p>
<p>There are 10 action script slots available, each of which is a standard
GUI action available from the menu and hence can be bound to a keyboard
shortcut.</p>

matching Ardour’s internal <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">::connect_and_run()</span></code> API, which
requires the caller to map and offset raw buffers.</li>
<li>plugin parameters are handled via the global variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CtrlPorts</span></code>.</li>
<li>midi data is passed via the global variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mididata</span></code> which is
valid during <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">dsp_run</span></code> only. (dsp_runmap requires the script to
pass raw data from the buffers according to in_map)</li>
<li>The script has access to the current session via the global variable
Session, but access to the session methods are limited to realtime
safe functions</li>

<span id="id82"></span><h3>Accessing Ardour Objects<a class="headerlink" href="#accessing-ardour-objects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The top most object in Ardour is the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ARDOUR::Session</span></code>. Fundamentally,
a Session is just a collection of other things: Routes (tracks, busses),
Sources (Audio/Midi), Regions, Playlists, Locations, Tempo map,
Undo/Redo history, Ports, Transport state and controls, etc.</p>
<p>Every Lua interpreter can access it via the global variable <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Session</span></code>.</p>
<p>GUI context interpreters also have an additional object in the global
environment: The Ardour <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Editor</span></code>. The Editor provides access to high
level functionality which is otherwise triggered via GUI interaction
such as undo/redo, open/close windows, select objects, drag/move
regions. It also holds the current UI state: snap-mode, zoom-range, etc.
The Editor also provides complex operations such as “import audio” which
under the hood, creates a new Track, adds a new Source Objects (for
every channel) with optional resampling, creates both playlist and
regions and loads the region onto the Track all the while displaying a
progress information to the user.</p>
<p>Documenting the bound C++ methods and class hierarchy is somewhere on
the ToDo list. Meanwhile
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/Ardour/ardour/blob/master/libs/ardour/luabindings.cc">luabindings.cc</a>
is the best we can offer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="concepts">
<span id="id83"></span><h3>Concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>There are no bound constructors: Lua asks Ardour to create objects
(e.g. add a new track), then receives a reference to the object to
modify it.</li>
<li>Scripts, once loaded, are saved with the Session (no reference to
external files). This provides for portable Sessions.</li>
<li>Lua Scripts are never executed directly. They provide a “factory”
method which can have optional instantiation parameters, which
returns a Lua closure.</li>
<li>No external Lua modules/libraries can be used, scripts need to be
self contained (portable across different systems (libs written in
Lua can be used, and important c-libs/functions can be included with
Ardour if needed).</li>
</ul>
<p>Ardour is a highly multithreaded application and interaction between the
different threads, particularly real-time threads, needs to to be done
with care. This part has been abstracted away by providing separate Lua
interpreters in different contexts and restricting available
interaction:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Editor Actions run in a single instance interpreter in the GUI
thread.</li>
<li>Editor Hooks connect to libardour signals. Every Callback uses a
dedicated Lua interpreter which is in the GUI thread context.</li>
<li>All Session scripts run in a single instance in the main real-time
thread (audio callback)</li>
<li>DSP scripts have a separate instance per script and run in one of the
DSP threads.</li>
</ul>
<p>The available interfaces differ between contexts. For example, it is not
possible to create new tracks or import audio from real-time context;
while it is not possible to modify audio buffers from the GUI thread.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="current-state">
<span id="id84"></span><h3>Current State<a class="headerlink" href="#current-state" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Fully functional, yet still in a prototyping stage:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The GUI to add/configure scripts is rather minimalistic.</li>
<li>The interfaces may change (particularly DSP, and Session script
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">run()</span></code>.</li>
<li>Further planned work includes:<ul>
<li>Built-in Script editor (customize/modify Scripts in-place)</li>
<li>convenience methods (wrap more complex Ardour actions into a
library). e.g set plugin parameters, write automation lists from a
Lua table</li>
<li>Add some useful scripts and more examples</li>

<p>This documentation is far from complete may be inaccurate and subject to
change.</p>
<div id="luaref"><p class="rubric" id="h-intro">Overview</p>
<p>The top-level entry point are <a class="reference external" href="#ARDOUR:Session">ARDOUR:Session</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="#ArdourUI:Editor">ArdourUI:Editor</a>. Most other Classes are used
indirectly starting with a Session function. e.g. Session:get_routes().</p>
<p>A few classes are dedicated to certain script types, e.g. Lua DSP
processors have exclusive access to <a class="reference external" href="#ARDOUR:DSP">ARDOUR.DSP</a> and
<a class="reference external" href="#ARDOUR:ChanMapping">ARDOUR:ChanMapping</a>. Action Hooks Scripts to
<a class="reference external" href="#LuaSignal:Set">LuaSignal:Set</a> etc.</p>
<p>Detailed documentation (parameter names, method description) is not yet
available. Please stay tuned.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="short-introduction-to-ardour-classes">Short introduction to Ardour classes</p>
<p>Ardour’s structure is object oriented. The main object is the Session. A
Session contains Audio Tracks, Midi Tracks and Busses. Audio and Midi
tracks are derived from a more general “Track” Object, which in turn is
derived from a “Route” (aka Bus). (We say “An Audio Track <em>is-a</em> Track
<em>is-a</em> Route”). Tracks contain specifics. For Example a track <em>has-a</em>
diskstream (for file i/o).</p>
<p>Operations are performed on objects. One gets a reference to an object
and then calls a method. e.g
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">obj</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">Session:route_by_name(&quot;Audio&quot;)</span>&#160;&#160; <span class="pre">obj:set_name(&quot;Guitar&quot;)</span></code>.</p>
<p>Lua automatically follows C++ class inheritance. e.g one can directly
call all SessionObject and Route methods on Track object. However lua
does not automatically promote objects. A Route object which just
happens to be a Track needs to be explicitly cast to a Track. Methods
for casts are provided with each class. Note that the cast may fail and
return a <em>nil</em> reference.</p>
<p>Likewise multiple inheritance is a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.lua.org/pil/16.3.html">non-trivial
issue</a> in lua. To avoid performance
penalties involved with lookups, explicit casts are required in this
case. One example is <a class="reference external" href="#ARDOUR:SessionObject">ARDOUR:SessionObject</a>
which is-a StatefulDestructible which inherits from both Stateful and
Destructible.</p>
<p>Object lifetimes are managed by the Session. Most Objects cannot be
directly created, but one asks the Session to create or destroy them.
This is mainly due to realtime constrains: you cannot simply remove a
track that is currently processing audio. There are various <em>factory</em>
methods for object creation or removal.</p>
<p class="rubric" id="pass-by-reference">Pass by Reference</p>
<p>Since lua functions are closures, C++ methods that pass arguments by
reference cannot be used as-is. All parameters passed to a C++ method
which uses references are returned as Lua Table. If the C++ method also
returns a value it is prefixed. Two parameters are returned: the value
and a Lua Table holding the parameters.</p>

<p>Libardour makes extensive use of reference counted <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">boost::shared_ptr</span></code>
to manage lifetimes. The Lua bindings provide a complete abstraction of
this. There are no pointers in lua. For example a
<a class="reference external" href="#ARDOUR:Route">ARDOUR:Route</a> is a pointer in C++, but lua functions
operate on it like it was a class instance.</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">shared_ptr</span></code> are reference counted. Once assigned to a lua variable,
the C++ object will be kept and remains valid. It is good practice to
assign references to lua <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">local</span></code> variables or reset the variable to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nil</span></code> to drop the ref.</p>
<p>All pointer classes have a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">isnil</span> <span class="pre">()</span></code> method. This is for two cases:
Construction may fail. e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ARDOUR.LuaAPI.newplugin()</span></code> may not be
able to find the given plugin and hence cannot create an object.</p>
<p>The second case if for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">boost::weak_ptr</span></code>. As opposed to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">boost::shared_ptr</span></code> weak-pointers are not reference counted. The
object may vanish at any time. If lua code calls a method on a nil
object, the interpreter will raise an exception and the script will not
continue. This is not unlike <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">a</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">nil</span> <span class="pre">a:test()</span></code> which results in en
error “<em>attempt to index a nil value</em>”.</p>
<p>From the lua side of things there is no distinction between weak and
shared pointers. They behave identically. Below they’re indicated in
orange and have an arrow to indicate the pointer type. Pointer Classes
cannot be created in lua scripts. It always requires a call to C++ to
create the Object and obtain a reference to it.</p>

<p><em>C‡</em>: ARDOUR::PortEngine</p>
<div class="clear"></div><div class="classdox"><p>PortEngine is an abstract base class that defines the functionality
required by Ardour.</p>
<p>A Port is basically an endpoint for a datastream (which can either be
continuous, like audio, or event-based, like MIDI). Ports have buffers
associated with them into which data can be written (if they are output
ports) and from which data can be read (if they input ports). Ports can
be connected together so that data written to an output port can be read
from an input port. These connections can be 1:1, 1:N OR N:1.</p>
<p>Ports may be associated with software only, or with hardware. Hardware
related ports are often referred to as physical, and correspond to some
relevant physical entity on a hardware device, such as an audio jack or
a MIDI connector. Physical ports may be potentially asked to monitor
their inputs, though some implementations may not support this.</p>
<p>Most physical ports will also be considered “terminal”, which means that
data delivered there or read from there will go to or comes from a
system outside of the PortEngine implementation’s control (e.g. the
analog domain for audio, or external MIDI devices for MIDI).
Non-physical ports can also be considered “terminal”. For example, the
output port of a software synthesizer is a terminal port, because the
data contained in its buffer does not and cannot be considered to come
from any other port - it is synthesized by its owner.</p>
<p>Ports also have latency associated with them. Each port has a playback
latency and a capture latency:</p>
<p><strong>capture latency</strong>: how long since the data read from the buffer of a
port arrived at at a terminal port. The data will have come from the
“outside world” if the terminal port is also physical, or will have been
synthesized by the entity that owns the terminal port.</p>
<p><strong>playback latency</strong>: how long until the data written to the buffer of
port will reach a terminal port.</p>
<p>For more detailed questions about the PortEngine API, consult the JACK
API documentation, on which this entire object is based.</p>

function-parameter. It provides no methods by itself.</p>

<div class="clear"></div><div class="classdox"><p>Context is the main class used to draw in cairomm. It contains the
current state of the rendering device, including coordinates of yet to
be drawn shapes.</p>
<p>In the simplest case, create a Context with its target Surface, set its
drawing options (line width, color, etc), create shapes with methods
like move_to() and line_to(), and then draw the shapes to the Surface
using methods such as stroke() or fill().</p>
<p>Context is a reference-counted object that should be used via
Cairo::RefPtr.</p>

<p>void</p>
<p>arc(double, double, double, double, double)</p>
<div class="dox"><p>Adds a circular arc of the given radius to the current path. The arc is
centered at (<em>xc,</em> <em>yc),</em> begins at <em>angle1</em> and proceeds in the
direction of increasing angles to end at <em>angle2.</em> If <em>angle2</em> is less
than <em>angle1</em> it will be progressively increased by 2*M_PI until it is
greater than <em>angle1.</em></p>
<p>If there is a current point, an initial line segment will be added to
the path to connect the current point to the beginning of the arc. If
this initial line is undesired, it can be avoided by calling
begin_new_sub_path() before calling arc().</p>
<p>Angles are measured in radians. An angle of 0 is in the direction of the
positive X axis (in user-space). An angle of M_PI/2.0 radians (90
degrees) is in the direction of the positive Y axis (in user-space).
Angles increase in the direction from the positive X axis toward the
positive Y axis. So with the default transformation matrix, angles
increase in a clockwise direction.</p>
<p>( To convert from degrees to radians, use degrees * (M_PI / 180.0). )</p>
<p>This function gives the arc in the direction of increasing angles; see
arc_negative() to get the arc in the direction of decreasing angles.</p>
<p>The arc is circular in user-space. To achieve an elliptical arc, you can
scale the current transformation matrix by different amounts in the X
and Y directions. For example, to draw an ellipse in the box given by x,
y, width, height:</p>

call the “toy” text API. It is convenient for short demos and simple
programs, but it is not expected to be adequate for serious text-using
applications. See show_glyphs() for the “real” text display API in

the direction of the underlying path.</p>
<p>2. A sub-path created by move_to() followed by either a close_path() or
one or more calls to line_to() to the same coordinate as the move_to().
If the cap style is Cairo::LINE_CAP_ROUND then these sub-paths will be
drawn as circular dots. Note that in the case of Cairo::LINE_CAP_SQUARE
a degenerate sub-path will not be drawn at all, (since the correct
orientation is indeterminate).</p>

<p><em>C‡</em>: Vamp::Plugin</p>
<p>is-a: <a class="reference external" href="#Vamp:PluginBase">Vamp:PluginBase</a></p>
<div class="clear"></div><div class="classdox"><p>Vamp::Plugin is a base class for plugin instance classes that provide
feature extraction from audio or related data.</p>
<p>In most cases, the input will be audio and the output will be a stream
of derived data at a lower sampling resolution than the input.</p>
<p>Note that this class inherits several abstract methods from PluginBase.
These must be implemented by the subclass.</p>
<p>PLUGIN LIFECYCLE</p>
<p>Feature extraction plugins are managed differently from real-time
plugins (such as VST effects). The main difference is that the
parameters for a feature extraction plugin are configured before the
plugin is used, and do not change during use.</p>
<p>1. Host constructs the plugin, passing it the input sample rate. The
plugin may do basic initialisation, but should not do anything
computationally expensive at this point. You must make sure your plugin
is cheap to construct, otherwise you’ll seriously affect the startup
performance of almost all hosts. If you have serious initialisation to
do, the proper place is in initialise() (step 5).</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Host may query the plugin’s available outputs.</li>
</ol>
<p>3. Host queries programs and parameter descriptors, and may set some or
all of them. Parameters that are not explicitly set should take their
default values as specified in the parameter descriptor. When a program
is set, the parameter values may change and the host will re-query them
to check.</p>
<p>4. Host queries the preferred step size, block size and number of
channels. These may all vary depending on the parameter values. (Note
however that you cannot make the number of distinct outputs dependent on
parameter values.)</p>
<p>5. Plugin is properly initialised with a call to initialise. This fixes
the step size, block size, and number of channels, as well as all of the
parameter and program settings. If the values passed in to initialise do
not match the plugin’s advertised preferred values from step 4, the
plugin may refuse to initialise and return false (although if possible
it should accept the new values). Any computationally expensive setup
code should take place here.</p>
<p>6. Host finally checks the number of values, resolution, extents etc per
output (which may vary depending on the number of channels, step size
and block size as well as the parameter values).</p>
<p>7. Host will repeatedly call the process method to pass in blocks of
input data. This method may return features extracted from that data (if
the plugin is causal).</p>
<p>8. Host will call getRemainingFeatures exactly once, after all the input
data has been processed. This may return any non-causal or leftover
features.</p>
<p>9. At any point after initialise was called, the host may optionally
call the reset method and restart processing. (This does not mean it can
change the parameters, which are fixed from initialise until
destruction.)</p>
<p>A plugin does not need to handle the case where setParameter or
selectProgram is called after initialise has been called. It’s the
host’s responsibility not to do that. Similarly, the plugin may safely
assume that initialise is called no more than once.</p>
</div><p>Methods</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="#Vamp.Plugin.InputDomain">InputDomain</a></p>
<p>getInputDomain()</p>
<div class="dox"><p>Get the plugin’s required input domain.</p>
<p>If this is TimeDomain, the samples provided to the process() function
(below) will be in the time domain, as for a traditional audio
processing plugin.</p>
<p>If this is FrequencyDomain, the host will carry out a windowed FFT of
size equal to the negotiated block size on the data before passing the
frequency bin data in to process(). The input data for the FFT will be
rotated so as to place the origin in the centre of the block. The plugin
does not get to choose the window type – the host will either let the
user do so, or will use a Hanning window.</p>

<p>getMaxChannelCount()</p>
<div class="dox"><p>Get the maximum supported number of input channels.</p>

<p>getOutputDescriptors()</p>
<div class="dox"><p>Get the outputs of this plugin. An output’s index in this list is used
as its numeric index when looking it up in the FeatureSet returned from
the process() call.</p>
</div><p>unsigned long</p>
<p>getPreferredBlockSize()</p>
<div class="dox"><p>Get the preferred block size (window size – the number of sample frames
passed in each block to the process() function). This should be called
before initialise().</p>
<p>A plugin that can handle any block size may return 0. The final block
size will be set in the initialise() call.</p>
</div><p>unsigned long</p>
<p>getPreferredStepSize()</p>
<div class="dox"><p>Get the preferred step size (window increment – the distance in sample
frames between the start frames of consecutive blocks passed to the
process() function) for the plugin. This should be called before
initialise().</p>
<p>A plugin may return 0 if it has no particular interest in the step size.
In this case, the host should make the step size equal to the block size
if the plugin is accepting input in the time domain. If the plugin is
accepting input in the frequency domain, the host may use any step size.
The final step size will be set in the initialise() call.</p>

<h2>86 - Files and Directories Ardour Knows About<a class="headerlink" href="#files-and-directories-ardour-knows-about" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="configuration-directory">
<h3>Configuration Directory<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration-directory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Ardour stores configuration files in two places. The system
configuration directory and the user configuration directory. The system
configuration directory is used for stock configuration files at install
time. The user configuration directory is used by Ardour to store
configuration changes made in the GUI as well as being a place the user
can add control surface device files, scripts etc.</p>
<p>Ardour tries to use standard places for these directories for the
platform it is running on.</p>
<div class="section" id="linux-2">
<span id="id463"></span><h4>Linux<a class="headerlink" href="#linux-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The user configuration directory will be somewhere inside the user’s
home directory. The home directory on a linux system is normally
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/home/$USER/</span></code>, but should also be returned by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$HOME</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~</span></code>. A
normal place to find this is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$HOME/.config/ardour*/</span></code> where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code> is
the major version. However this can be set by the system with the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$XDG_CONFIG_HOME</span></code> environment variable to something else. If you
cannot find <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$HOME/.config/</span></code> on your system try
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">echo</span> <span class="pre">${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}</span></code> to see if your distro is using something
else. In any case Ardour appends the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ardour*</span></code> directory to the result
where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code> is the major version number. For example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ardour5</span></code> where
the Ardour version is 5.6.</p>
<p>In Linux, all path names are lowercase and case-sensitive.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="macos">
<h4>macOS<a class="headerlink" href="#macos" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The user configuration directory on macOS is
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$HOME/Library/Preferences/Ardour*/</span></code> where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code> is the major version
number. For example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ardour5</span></code> where the Ardour version is 5.6.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="windows">
<h4>Windows<a class="headerlink" href="#windows" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Windows users are not expected to hand edit configuration files at all.
It is expected configuration options are changed with some sort of GUI
tool. For the most part all of Ardour’s configuration is taken care of
by the GUI in preferences. However, there are devices that may need a
custom file and that would be in the users configuration directory.</p>
<p>Ardour asks the system for this directory and then appends <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ardour*</span></code>
to the path where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">*</span></code> is the major version number. For example,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ardour5</span></code> where the Ardour version is 5.6. The official path would
look like: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%localappdata%\Ardour5\</span></code> Windows expands
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%localappdata%</span></code> to a real path.</p>
<p>An example of a configuration path in Window 10 would be:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C:\&lt;User&gt;\AppData\Local\Ardour5\</span></code> The user in the path would be the
user’s account name.</p>
<p>The above is only an example and may not even be true for all
installations of Windows 10.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="plugins-1">
<span id="id464"></span><h3>Plugins<a class="headerlink" href="#plugins-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Plugins will be installed in various places, some by standard and some
by developer whim. Some are installed incorrectly by distro policy.</p>
<div class="section" id="linux-3">
<span id="id465"></span><h4>Linux<a class="headerlink" href="#linux-3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In linux there are 3 kinds of plugins Ardour can use. LADSPA, LV2
(LADSPA version 2) or lxvst (VSTs compiled as native linux binaries).
While it is possible with some strange magic to run <a class="reference external" href="#using-windows-vst-plugins-on-linux">Windows
VSTs</a> on linux, their
whereabouts would follow the Windows info below.</p>
<div class="section" id="id466">
<h5>LADSPA<a class="headerlink" href="#id466" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>LADSPA plugins should be found in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/usr/lib/ladspa/</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/usr/local/lib/ladspa/</span></code> or in a directory mentioned in your
LADSPA_PATH environment variable. The most common mistake made by distro
packagers, is to use a path like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/usr/lib/$ARCH/ladspa/</span></code> and find
that Ardour will not find that by default. The user can either add a
link from this actual directory to the standard directory or add this
path to LADSPA_PATH.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id467">
<h5>LV2<a class="headerlink" href="#id467" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>LADSPA plugins should be found in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/usr/lib/lv2/</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/usr/local/lib/lv2/</span></code> or in a directory mentioned in your LV2_PATH
environment variable. The most common mistake made by distro packagers,
is to use a path like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/usr/lib/$ARCH/lv2/</span></code> and find that Ardour will
not find that by default. The user can either add a link from this
actual directory to the standard directory or add this path to LV2_PATH.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="linux-vst-or-lxvst">
<h5>Linux VST or lxvst<a class="headerlink" href="#linux-vst-or-lxvst" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>They are typically installed in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/usr/lib/lxvst</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/usr/local/lib/lxvst</span></code> or a directory mentioned in your LXVST_PATH
environment variable. However, this is not a standard and the VST plugin
developer may install the plugin just about anywhere. Therefore Ardour
allows the user to set extra VST paths in the preferences GUI under
Plugins&gt;VST.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="macos-1">
<span id="id468"></span><h4>macOS<a class="headerlink" href="#macos-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>On the Mac, plugins are expected to be installed correctly Ardour uses
the system tool to scan for AU style plugins and LV2s should be in the
right place. LV2 should be in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$HOME/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/LV2/</span></code>
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/LV2/</span></code> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/usr/local/lib/lv2/</span></code>
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/usr/lib/lv2/</span></code> If an AU or LV2 plugin does not show up on a Mac it is
probably a development fault with the plugin and the plugin will not
work with anything. Ardour in Ardour 5.6 has support for native VST
plugins. That is VST plugins built for OSX. I am not sure if these have
a standard place to be, but as with other VSTs the search path can be
edited at Plugins&gt;VST.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="windows-1">
<span id="id469"></span><h4>Windows<a class="headerlink" href="#windows-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The most common plugins on Windows are VSTs. However, LADSPA and LV2
plugins are available for windows as well. In fact Ardour’s built in
plugins are LV2s. The biggest advantage of LV2 plugins is that they are
the most likely to be cross platform and therefore allow the same Ardour
project to be worked on in Windows, OSX and Linux.</p>
<div class="section" id="vst-1">
<span id="id470"></span><h5>VST<a class="headerlink" href="#vst-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>As with other platforms, VSTs on Windows do not have a standard place to
reside. Ardour Preferences&gt;Plugins&gt;VST allows setting the VST path from
the GUI.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lv2-1">
<span id="id471"></span><h5>LV2<a class="headerlink" href="#lv2-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The LV2 standard for Windows is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%APPDATA%/LV2/</span></code> (On Windows 10:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C:\&lt;User&gt;\AppData\Roaming\LV2\</span></code>)%COMMONPROGRAMFILES%/LV2/ (On Windows
10: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">C:\Program</span> <span class="pre">Files\LV2\</span></code>).</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project-directory">
<h3>Project Directory<a class="headerlink" href="#project-directory" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Ardour places a project directory where the user tells it to. This
directory is chosen when creating a project. In most cases the user does
not need to know about the files inside of the project directory.
However there are a few sub-directories worth noting.</p>
<div class="section" id="export-1">
<span id="id472"></span><h4>export<a class="headerlink" href="#export-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
